  * Actualy Not bad for this model....

    * About the data file:
      * ok so i didnt Fucking webscrape the Lyrics,,
      
      * Cos Its So Foggy to figure out and I just copy Past

      * But i think The model quite good,, Also the len(char) of txt == >150K
  
  * Also The tiny_Ksi.txt has Small Amout of data
  
### TRain Again with more DATA / Tiny_KSI_.txt
  
  * So i Adjust the para., Cos It's Overfit the data since i scaled the hyper para

  * And i retrain the model with same para i used when i train[# with tiny_Ksi.txt]

  * **The Loss has became down to  Train Loss [1.0560], val/dev Loss [1.5778]**
    + I think this Gen are quit good actualy, 

    + Train on balanced data i might think [len(char)== >=200K],

    + ANd overall i think this is a successfull project :)
