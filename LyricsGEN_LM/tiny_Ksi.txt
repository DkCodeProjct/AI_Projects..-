[Chorus: KSI]
I'm in the thick of it, everybody knows
They know me where it snows, I skied in and they froze
I don't know no nothin' 'bout no ice, I'm just cold
Forty somethin' milli' subs or so, I've been told

[Verse 1: KSI]
I'm in my prime, and this ain't even final form
They knocked me down, but still, my feet, they find the floor
I went from living rooms straight out to sold-out tours
Life's a fight, but trust, I'm ready for the war

[Pre-Chorus: KSI]
Woah-oh-oh
This is how the story goes
Woah-oh-oh
I guess this is how the story goes

[Chorus: KSI]
I'm in the thick of it, everybody knows
They know me where it snows, I skied in and they froze
I don't know no nothin' 'bout no ice, I'm just cold
Forty somethin' milli' subs or so, I'vе been told

[Verse 2: KSI]
From the screen to the ring, to the pеn, to the king
Where's my crown? That's my bling, always drama when I ring
See, I believe that if I see it in my heart
Smash through the ceiling 'cause I'm reaching for the stars

[Pre-Chorus: KSI]
Woah-oh-oh
This is how the story goes
Woah-oh-oh
I guess this is how the story goes

[Chorus: KSI & Trippie Redd]
I'm in the thick of it, everybody knows
They know me where it snows, I skied in and they froze (Woo)
I don't know no nothin' 'bout no ice, I'm just cold
Forty somethin' milli' subs or so, I've been told

[Verse 3: Trippie Redd, KSI, Trippie Redd & KSI]
Highway to heaven, I'm just cruisin' by my lone'
They cast me out, left me for dead, them people cold
My faith in God, mind in the sun, I'm 'bout to sow (Yeah)
My life is hard, I took the wheel, I cracked the code (Yeah-yeah, woah-oh-oh)
Ain't nobody gon' save you, man, this life will break you (Yeah, woah-oh-oh)
In the thick of it, this is how the story goes

[Chorus: KSI, Trippie Redd, KSI & Trippie Redd]
I'm in the thick of it, everybody knows

[Pre-Chorus: KSI]
Got rocks on my wrist, that shit you can't resist
Cash flow greater than the haters hating on my gyst
Riding in your face, looking like I found a damn genie
Wiling in my Lamborghini

[Chorus: KSI]
La-Lamborghini, La-Lamborghini
Bitch, I know you see me in my Lamborghini (Yeah)
La-Lamborghini, La-Lamborghini
Ride so quick, you would think I'm Houdini (Boom!)

[Verse 1: KSI]
B-B-Been in the game since Namco, ah-ah
Bring it back, I'm fully gassed, yo
Vroom, vroom, in my brand new Lambo
Juiced up, and I don't give a damn, yo
Going 120 (Yeah), and that's my slowest
On a one-way lane, like Lois (Argh)
Who's that? Superman's bitch
Wanna see what happens when I touch the Superman switch?
Ride with more peers than Morgan (What's up?)
Drive past vloggers that are walking
I taunt them, Matt Lees, can you see me? (Ha-Ha-Ha)
Wiling in my Lamborghini

[Pre-Chorus: KSI]
Got rocks on my wrist, that shit you can't resist
Cash flow greater than the haters hating on my gyst

[Verse 2: P Money]
Oh yeah
I be at home on the Xbox
Lord of the Mics in the background, slewing MCs with dreadlocks
Snap that party, told this girl "come round"
Chick's long-tempered but her head top (Whoa)
She goes hard till my head drops, oi
It's all eyes when we connect, oi
Doggystyle and a Playboy bunny from downstairs, upstairs
Sound like a pet shop (Mad)
Guys wanna hype on man
Call KSI, come yours and I'll put you in a headlock
I've been around since COD 4
Search and Destroy hardcore G3 with a red dot
Haters get treated like a ho
You can tell them suck my dick and get lost
Paparazzi wanna take pics when I'm out with my son
You can all get headshots
This flow's like Formula One
Cause I use the track like DRS
Quickly boosting the PRS
She's going ape when I beat her chest
Bro (Bro), it's mad (Mad)
You can tell Rihanna come see me
Might have to speed dial in that genie
JJ, lend me the Lamborghini

[Chorus: KSI]
La-Lamborghini, La-Lamborghini
Bitch, I know you see me in my Lamborghini (Yeah)
La-Lamborghini, La-Lamborghini
Ride so quick, you would think I'm Houdini (Boh!)

[Verse 3: KSI]
When my Lambo on the track (What?), fall back
When I'm riding at speed, get that neck crack, ah-ah
Blazing on the engine, everybody looking back (Yeah)
Like I'm shooting, gra-ta-ta, got them going "fuck that"
Raise the fucking doors, I said make it look
Like a fucking eagle, like I'm starting wars
Dictating with my V12 deagle, speeds ain't even legal
Scaring people, we ain't equal
Danny Glover ain't got shit on my motherfucking lethal weapon
Armageddon sounding when the man arrives (Yeah-Yeah)
When we hype I come alive, like a 5 Alive
On the drive 21 years, smashing up the scene (Ah, Ha-Ha-Ha)
And I keep on winning, like I'm Mr Charlie Sheen

[Chorus: KSI]
La-Lamborghini, La-Lamborghini
Bitch, I know you see me in my Lamborghini (Yeah)
La-Lamborghini, La-Lamborghini
Ride so quick, you would think I'm Houdini

Little boy tryna get involved
Come on, then, come on, then, let's get involved, you prick
Posh boy now wanna rap (Mmm)
Posh boy now wanna scrap (Mmm)
Posh boy 'bout to get clapped
By the end of the verse, you're gonna wish you never did that
Wish you never hit back, Guernsey’s little boy's gonna feel it
When I get with the click-click-click-clack
You ain't part of this group (Nah)
You ain't Sidemen, you gook (Nah)
Deciding when to be a Sideman
While you're too busy faking all the packs
And then making racks and spending all of that shit on
Now, Rosie a sket
And I know that you're listening beginning to sweat (Ooh)

[Bridge]
Little boy not looking innocent all 'cause he wanna be relevant (Oh, god)
Tatted my name on my body so you know I'm now in my element (I'm in my element)
Call me whatever you want, still looking up to me (Fuck, sake)
Sidemen the name of the group, all 'cause they needed the help from me
[Verse 2]
Yeah, bitch, I was the come-up
I'm the foundation for you to go run up
Keep playing FIFA, you ignorant fuck
Your girl is a gold digger, fuck
At least she knows how to suck (Oh, shit)
Wipe the floor when I deal with scrubs
Come at me, but I win in subs
I'm the giant, just killing bugs
You're just a shit ChrisMD
You need to get off MD
How many girls have you fucked in your life?
One, that's mad
Your girlfriend's forehead, mad
When you ask the sket to go give you head
Her reply is "Which one?" (Ah)

[Chorus]
Your dad is a weirdo (Ayy)
He looks just like a pedo (Ayy)
More inbred than yeast (Ayy)
Your mum gets fucked by sheep (Ayy)
Your sister fucks a crowbar (Ayy)
Fam, it's really that deep (Ayy)
Sorry, nigga, but I said it (Ayy)
Little boy, now regret it

Why you gotta go, go and let me down like that? (Ayy)
Down like that
Oh, why? Why you go and let me down like that? (Ayy)
Down like
I was nothin' but loyal to you right from the start
You changed up on me as soon as things were getting hard
I've only seen the light despite us being in the dark
And you let me down like that, yeah, down like that (Oh why)

[Verse 1: KSI]
Yeah, yeah, I want that knockdown
Fuck up the system, make it shut down
I'm cold with this, slow man down like Freezer (Mm)
Wanna backstab like Frieza (Mm)
Dictate death like Caesar (Mm)
Always come through with a bee (Yeah)
Got to do a lot to trouble me (Yeah)
Visionary still won't tunnel me (Yeah)
Me to you, now that will chuckle me (Yeah)
Devilish views when they're aiming at the prophet
Emitting pain 'til you're nothing
Remember what I said when that pussy tried moving with the opps? (Woo)
Now he back with the blocks, nigga

[Chorus: S-X, Rick Ross & Jessica Gomes]
Why you gotta go, go and let me down like that? (Ayy)
Down like that
Oh, why? Why you go and let me down like that? (Ayy)
Down like
I was nothin' but loyal to you right from the start
You changed up on me as soon as things were getting hard
I've only seen the light despite us being in the dark
And you let me down like that, yeah (It's the biggest in the game)
Down like that (Uh, uh)
(M-M-Maybach Music)

[Verse 2: Rick Ross & Lil Baby]
Phantoms in my yard, so ring around the Rolls (Skrrt)
Hardest on the block, the biggest one, da boss (Huh)
Helicopter pad the home of Sammy Sosa (Biggest)
Still stealing all the bases, I'm the ladies token (Woo)
Bitches always bad, I'm known to blow the budgets (Huh)
Meek was at the crib, so double M the subject (Ahh)
Condo got three levels, Postmate all the lunches (Woo)
Flippin' all the kilos, keepin' all the grudges (Uh, Baby, ayy, boss)

[Verse 3: Lil Baby]
Ain't no more let-downs unless the top getting dropped
I love it at the top, my concierge don't ever stop me
You know I fuck with Ross, I even went and bought the block
A hundred million dollars strong, I really came from sellin' rocks
Championship belt, them VVS's spark
Steal it, hit the gas and get out on the narcs
Killers move for free, I just can't pick a cost
Put the drip on market took it to the charts
Now I'm rocking with the biggest
And I'm fucking with the boss, I'm out

[Chorus: S-X]
Why you gotta go, go and let me down like that? (Ayy)
Down like that
Oh, why? Why you go and let me down like that? (Ayy)
Down like

You changed up on me as soon as things start getting hard
I've only seen the light despite us being in the dark
And you let me down like that, yeah, down like that
Oh, why? (Yeah)

[Chorus]
I got millions on my mind (mind)
Still I get so anxious (ooh)
And I can't help me

[Refrain]
Got my feelings on the line and I get no answers (ooh)
Something wrong with me?
'Cause I'm not on cloud nine
I don't wanna breathe
I don't wanna be your B

[Chorus]
I got millions on my mind (mind)
Still I get so anxious
And I can't help me

[Verse 1]
Money can't buy happiness, only rents it
I told myself I wanna finish it and I meant it
I hated every fucking second, hated every mention
Searching and screaming for all the reasons
That you wanted more appealing and attention
You turned my blood against me, you made me hate my bestie
You fucking ruined me, man, but you don't care
Every message that I would send you'd just air
Oh well, fuck it, you got what you wanted (mmm)
At my expense, you did it, you already won it (ah mm)
And now I'm picking up my pieces, done with all your leases (oh ahmm)
I hope you hear this and hate it (ahh mm)

[Chorus]
I got millions on my mind (mind)
Still I get so anxious (ooh)
And I can't help me

[Refrain]
Got my feelings on the line and I get no answers (ooh)
Something wrong with me?
'Cause I'm not on cloud nine
I don't wanna breathe
I don't wanna be your B

[Chorus]
I got millions on my mind (mind)
Still I get so anxious
And I can't help me


[Verse 2]
I know I'm not easy to be around
Hard times, you're holding me down and I like how you smile
Even when I make a fool of myself, still
You want nobody else, and that shit really helps
Diamond in the rough, you know I mean it
You don't want the money or the fame, you'd rather leave it (yeah)
Leave it just to help out all the people with their mental
Fundamental, you are my sentimental dealer (oh)
Turning down my compliments, I really hate it
Since I'm tryna boost your confidence, I really made it
Since you helped me with my issues, stronger than ever
Want you to know it
Forever

[Chorus]
I got millions on my mind (mind)
Still I get so anxious (ooh)
And I can't help me

[Refrain]
Got my feelings on the line and I get no answers (ooh)
Something wrong with me?
'Cause I'm not on cloud nine
I don't wanna breathe
I don't wanna be your B

[Chorus]
I got millions on my mind (mind)
Still I get so anxious
And I can't help me

Stone cold with the midget, wrist spinning like a fidget
Chick banging like a Cillit, I don't even have a digit
On the 'Gram is how I pitch it, I go ham and then I switch it
I go ham in every single matter with the social ladder
You can't stop me flowing like a badder bladder
Got me spamming kappa, I'm way more than just a fucking rapper
I've embodied double dapper strappers
Saw me swinging winning I'm a proper scrapper
I'm too high to feel a low, I just buy whatever goes
I just want another rose, big booty in her clothes
Pussy popping when I close, dirty man like I'm SimSimi
Horny rabbit, I'm like gimme gimme
Make commotion when I'm in my city
Dropping bag on bag while he shimmy shimmy
See me spending lavish in a boulevard
I don't credit, I just debit card
Tax man got me on their radar
But I pay my taxes so why the fuck

Strawberry shirts in the sunshine
Ice-cold drinks 'til the moonlight

Make me wanna do a mad ting (Mad ting)
See me when I'm on my Don King
And I kill it with the millies, so I get another ring for the bae

[Chorus: Swarmz & Tion Wayne]
Oh, na, nah, you don't wanna ramp with me
Oh, la, la, run up on man, then squeeze
Easy peasy squeezy
Talkin' bad until you see me (Come on, come on)
Make man, just like Houdini (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Tion Wayne]
T Wayne from the 9
She does a likkle tweet, tweet and a likkle snap, snap
Preeing up her Insta', all I do is tap, tap (Come on, come on)
I ain't into talking, but she make me chat, chat (Ayy)
I'ma do anything, just so they could have that
See me, I do it better (Ayy), she flexin' in my sweater (Sweater)
People, I can't trust them like the weather

Money on her B-day (Ayy), I don't do no letter
Love to spend grands (Money)
Got one young G, all he know is bang (Boom)

Made no paper actin' on cam
Love a real deal, not a lie (Lie)

Girl buss it down, look hot like July (Ayy)
Got girls at the table, meet KSI (KSI)

[Chorus: Swarmz & KSI]
Oh, na, nah, you don't wanna ramp with me
Oh, la, la, run up on man, and squeeze (I squeeze)
Easy peasy squeezy (Ayy)

Oh, na, nah, you don't wanna ramp with me
Oh, la, la, run up on man, then squeeze
Easy peasy squeezy
Talkin' bad until you see me
Make man, just like Houdini

[Intro: KSI & Polo G]
Little bit, little bit, little bit
Need a little bit of patience
'Cause we've be goin' through changes
Uh, uh

[Verse 1: Polo G]
No patience, I've had enough
Spent too much time through these phases
It's just not addin' up
Felt all alone on those stages
Wanna get my passion up
It's over, pack it up
Don't walk away from me
When the night falls, yeah, make the right call
Or she'll be gone forever

[Chorus: YUNGBLUD & KSI]
I need a little bit of patience
'Cause we've been goin' through changes
I need a little bit of patience
Get out of crazy situations (Ayy)
And my heart won't change
If my head don't break
I need a little bit of patience
'Cause we've been goin' through changes (Woah)

[Verse 2: KSI]
Need a little space to slow the brain
I don't really wanna feel the pain
Seen a lot of shit to make me hate
I don't wanna hide until it's too late
Feels like I'm gonna break

[Chorus: YUNGBLUD & KSI]
I need a little bit of patience
'Cause we've been goin' through changes
I need a little bit of patience
Get out of crazy situations (Ayy)
And my heart won't change (Ch-ch-change)
If my head don't break
I need a little bit of patience
'Cause we've been goin' through changes (Woah)

[Bridge: KSI]
Bridges burnin', I won't let you get to me
Tables turnin', I don't need bad energy
Now I'm learnin', lyin' 'bout our chemistry
No returnin', I

[Chorus: YUNGBLUD & KSI, YUNGBLUD & KSI]
I need a little bit of patience
'Cause we've been goin' through changes
I need a little bit of patience
Get out of crazy situations (Ayy)
And my heart won't change (Ch-ch-change, yeah)
If my head don't break
I need a little bit of patience
'Cause we've been goin' through changes

[Outro: KSI]
Need a little bit of patience
'Cause we've been goin' through changes

[Intro: Randolph]
Randolph, yeah, yeah
Zeeshan

[Verse 1: Randolph]
Ah, you don't like me that's established
Keyboard warrior, ugly ass catfish
You can never @ this
Out here, living that lavish life
You should be embarrassed, yikes
Cash in the vault so it's safe to say
Your boy stay dry on them rainy days
Royal flow, put me centre stage
Walter White, bitches say my name
Coming at me, you need stamina, this ain't for amateurs
Waiting for hours and hours to shine on the camera
Still got you powerless
Life is a bitch but she look like an hourglass
Got no time for this shit
Doubling down because I'm tryna get rich
And I'm tryna take it to another level
Got a hundred bags for a hundred bezels
I'm a fuckin' rebel, I shoot first
Carry the game 'cause her shoes hurt
Put it all on my back, weather the storm
Then make it rain 'til it's three in the morn'
From dirt, to rock, to private planes
Home studios to live on stage
And ain't nothin' changed
We've been going in since day
Uh, loyalty pays
You've been waiting for that royalty wage
It's never gonna come, is it?
Like your girl, throw me her digits
I'ma show her what a real man like
Plenty commas when we fly
No empty bottles day or night
For this life, it's ride or die

[Chorus: KSI]
Young winner come fear us
I'm a God like Beerus
Made my mark like Overmars
I don't see nobody comin' near us
Ain't no limit where we're goin' now
I got women, always showin' now
On the viewin' any Judas loomin'
Make 'em missin', ain't nobody kissin' now

[Verse 2: KSI]
Young winner, young sinner, peace out when I'm done in her
Head spinner, cash printer, brother, I'm the breadwinner
Bread butter, run gunner, UMP the soul stunner
Danny Glover weapon lover, end them so they never bother
Woah, my life I'm keepin' it all on the low
Who am I fuckin'? Oh, you wanna know
Started this all on my own
With the venomous flow as the C to the E to the O
I came in Gold with the fitness
Millions all over to witness
Millions all over the bank
Millions all over the business
Can't come at me, upper echelon
The real OG, the YouTube don
Fuck your number one, 'cause I'm limitless
Don't fuck with me, else I'm leavin' you spiritless
Nah, nah, nah
Why is my ex tryna message? I don't wanna talk to you
Nah, nah, nah
Even this guy wants some money, you know I don't fuck with you
Nah, nah, nah
Tweeting your piece on the net, let me come there and humble you
Nah, nah, nah
I'm on a level where even the Devil is scared of me
I got some enemies
Always will hate 'til I die, 'cus I fucked up their legacy
Negative energies
All of the bitches I finish, I keep them in memory
Fuck all my enemies
I am the king of the sheep, you can stay as a wannabe
Keep being under me
I'm on another level, I'm a new age rebel 'cus

[Chorus: KSI]
Young winner come fear us (Fear us)
I'm a God like Beerus (Beerus)
Made my mark like Overmars
I don't see nobody comin' near us (Near us)
Ain't no limit where we're goin' now (Goin' now)
I got women, always showin' now (Showin' now)
On the viewin' any Judas loomin'
Make 'em missin', ain't nobody kissin' now
Young winner come fear us (Fear us)
I'm a God like Beerus (Beerus)
Made my mark like Overmars
I don't see nobody comin' near us (Near us)
Ain't no limit where we're goin' now (Goin' now)
I got women, always showin' now (Showin' now)
On the viewin' any Judas loomin'
Make 'em missin', ain't nobody kissin' now

[Outro: KSI]
Motherfucker, yeah

[Intro]
It sounds like Nyge

[Verse 1: JME]
Yeah, Christmas party, Christmas knees up
Man pulled up, didn't see one knee up (Dead)
Everyone's stush, don't wanna free up
It's fuckin' October, why is your tree up? (What?)
Been wrappin' them gifts in cunch
Dropping 'em off tryna get my P up (O.T., O.T.)
Then John Lewis put out that shit advert
Tryna make man spend his re-up (What?)
Three in the morning, man can't sleep (Pricks)
My neighbours lighting up the whole street (Pricks)
NPower, SSE, EON, EDF Energy (Chit-chat)
Them man there raking in the Ps (Trust)
Dumb consumers still can't see
Mummy's trying to make ends meet
Christmas extortion, Christmas greed

[Verse 2: Tobi]
Down your spine, you'll feel a tingle (Yeah)
When you hear this festive jingle (Yeah)
This one's drill, not pop likе Pringle
You can get wrapped up, no Kris Kringlе (Bow)
See, it's Christmas and you don't wanna miss this (Yeah)
Don't need lights 'cause we're bringing the litness (Yeah)
So you're better off hidin' your missus 'cause I'm top of her wishlist (Ayy, ayy)
Santa's sleigh, I might jack that (Yeah, yeah)
Christmas presents, I stack that (Yeah, yeah)
Mrs. Claus got a fat back (Mm-hmm)
So I might have to tap that (Uh)
Then I'm leaving in Santa's ride (Santa's ride)
If the elves try run up on bro, then it's beef, so I have to slide (Have to slide)

[Chorus: KSI]
Christmas drillings, make a killin' (Killin')
We got them children cryin' now that Santa Claus is missin'
Ain't no presents 'til your birthday (Ain't no, ain't no)
Ain't no presents 'til your birthday (Ooh)
Christmas drillings, make a killin'
Spending all your P, don't look under the tree
Ain't no presents 'til your birthday (Ayy, ain't no presents, ain't no presents)
Ain't no presents 'til your birthday (Ayy)
Ooh-ooh-oh

[Verse 3: Vikkstar, KSI & Tobi]
It's the one, two, three (Mm-hmm)
Man'll cut down your Christmas tree (Jeez)
Gonna take this flow out in the snow, back to skid row, fuck mistletoe
Pull up on Santa and jack his sleigh (Uh-huh)
Him and his elves might pass away (Uh-huh)
Run 'em all over with his sled
Out in Lapland, snow turned red
He's dead (He's dead, he's dead)
Santa got put in a spliff, irrelevant myth
End of his presence, I plead the fifth
Body is stiff (Jeez, huh)

[Verse 4: KSI]
Yeah, Merry Christmas
See man jacking presents (All of them)
Fuck your life, this ain't Evanescence
Man don't want socks (Nah), man don't want Crocs (Nah)
Man tryna grab your mum
Bend her over, slide in just to show them how I stuff that turkey (Jeez)
Primed up (What?), all my opps get banged up (What?)
Sit man down with a one-two piece
And I push-up to win with hands up (Shut up)
And I come to Christmas wavy
Priced up but I'm not Katie
Solo man but I'm not Stacey
I'm the man, but I'm no baby

[Chorus: KSI]
Christmas drillings, make a killin' (Killin')
We got them children cryin' now that Santa Claus is missin'
Ain't no presents 'til your birthday (Ain't no, ain't no)
Ain't no presents 'til your birthday (Ooh)
Christmas drillings, make a killin'
Spending all your P, don't look under the tree
Ain't no presents 'til your birthday (Ayy, ain't no presents, Ain't no presents)
Ain't no presents 'til your birthday (Ayy)
Ooh-ooh-oh

[Intro]
So, you've been gone a while
Yeah, I know
What have you been doing?
Learning, I've been doing a lot of learning
Yeah, I'm ready now

[Verse 1]
I ain't tryna tell anybody how to live
My only advice is to love and forgive
Everybody born in this world has a gift
The lightning strikes in your life but you'll live
Everytime we growing they'll try slowing all of the progress that we make
Fix up, look sharp, let them come all the way
Michael Bay how we blowing, glowing
Stars in the bay overflowing in our space
Blair like Tony, let them know we hit back like
One Punch Man, bring a fist to the scheme in the way
To the point of decay
No dead ringer, middle finger to all the bullshit
When they blare it in your motherfucking face
When they treat you like a motherfucking creature

[Chorus]
Creature
Machines
Machines
Creature

[Verse 2]
Oh okay, well then finish it
I ain't tryna tell anybody what to do
But this is how it smells when you're raised in a zoo
They teach you how to sell, how to aim, how to shoot
Then when you end up in a jail then they'll blame it on you (on you)
That's not how I'm having it
Fuck you, I'm hijacking it
I'ma full blown go attacking it
People can you hear me
Said that's not how I'm having it
Fuck you, I'm hijacking it
I'ma full blown go attacking it
People can you hear me?
From the front to the back I'ma reacher like Jack
Man don't care what the people say
I'ma get the ting my own way
Take my whole name and own it
Can't control me and you know it
I'ma kill it when you treat me like a motherfucking creature

[Chorus]
Creature
Machines
Machines
Creature

[Intro: Ella Henderson & KSI]
I used to think I couldn't be without you, be without you
Now that you’re gone, I feel happy as hell (KSI, Nathan Dawe, ah)

[Bridge: Ella Henderson]
When you said it was over
I knew I'd fallen too deep
You made my world feel perfect
Then pulled it from under my feet

[Pre-Chorus: Ella Henderson]
I cried for a minute
For a while, I was tryin' to figure out what went wrong
Now I finally get it
And I see I don’t need you to be here, I'm movin' on

[Chorus: Ella Henderson & KSI]
I used to think I couldn't be without you, be without you
Now that you're gone, I feel happy as hell
Weight off of me
I can breathe without you, breathe without you
Now that you're gone, I feel lighter
I used to think I couldn't be without you, be without you
Now that you're gone, I feel happy as hell
Weight off of me
I can breathe without you, breathe without you (Ayy, ayy)
Now that you’re gone, I feel lighter (Nathan)

[Verse: KSI]
I’m feelin' so good like a fat man with a peng ting (Yeah)
Feelin’ so high like a black Yao Ming (Ayy)
Call me Godzilla 'cause I got a big part (Uh)
Went through war, got a purple heart
Needed my space, time, recovery
Now man's ace, quick, summary
New discovery, losin' that weight
Post on the ’Gram 'cause I'm just bait
I'm way too slick with it (Woo), John Wick with it (Woo)
I'm takin' bare shots in a quick minute (Ayy)
More drinks with it, bare sick with it (Come on)
Still end up in a bed with a chick in it (Mad)
VVS1 on my chain, bust down
Been through a lot, now a man's got a crown (It's mad)
KSI verified, stay schemin', self-believin', you know I

[Chorus: Ella Henderson]
I used to think I couldn't be without you, be without you
Now that you're gone, I feel happy as hell
Weight off of me
I can breathe without you, breathe without you
Now that you're gone, I feel lighter
I used to think I couldn't be without you, be without you
Now that you're gone, I feel happy as hell
Weight off of me
I can breathe without you, breathe without you
Now that you're gone, I feel lighter (Yeah, mm)

[Pre-Chorus: Ella Henderson]
I cried for a minute
For a while, I was tryin' to figure out what went wrong
Now I finally get it
And I see, I don't need you to be here, I'm movin' on (Oh, no, oh)

[Chorus: Ella Henderson]
I used to think I couldn't be without you, be without you
Now that you're gone, I feel happy as hell
Weight off of me
I can breathe without you, breathe without you
Now that you're gone, I feel lighter

[Outro: Ella Henderson]
(Gone) I feel lighter
(Gone) I feel lighter
(Gone) I feel lighter
(Gone) I feel lighter
(Gone) I feel lighter
(Gone) I feel lighter (Oh, no)
Now that you're gone, I feel lighter

[Chorus: Craig David]
Is it really love? Is it all in my mind?
Is it crazy I think of you all of the time, baby?
Is it really love? Can you give me a sign?
'Cause I'm losing my head tryna make you mine
Is it really love? Is it all in my mind?
Is it crazy I think of you all of the time, baby?
Is it really love? Can you give me a sign?
'Cause I'm losing my head tryna make you mine, oh

[Verse 1: KSI & Craig David]
Got a lot of time for the one that I'm watching
Amazon Prime if you wanna get something
No valentine but my heartbeat pumpin’ (umpin’, pumpin’)
(Tryna make you mine)
Now the room poppin'
Got plenty views if you hang around me
So many hearts if you see the IG
Stung many timеs by the people that I ratе
Still my record look great like Muhammad Ali
I'm tryna go, I'm tryna get wavy
On holiday, I'm wanting this daily
Man's bait when he's wearing that paisley
Still great coz my living now pays me
Don't cook but my chef like Ainsley
No look ting when I'm shooting my babies
Top striker, I'm hardly missing
New car so we need to christen, listen

[Chorus: Craig David]
Is it really love? Is it all in my mind?
Is it crazy I think of you all of the time, baby?
Is it really love? Can you give me a sign?
'Cause I'm losing my head tryna make you mine
Is it really love? Is it all in my mind?
Is it crazy I think of you all of the time, baby?
Is it really love? Can you give me a sign?
'Cause I'm losing my head tryna make you mine, oh

[Verse 2: KSI & Craig David]
Obsessed with the fitness
That booty got me moving with the stiffness
Praying that I finally get to hit this
(Tryna make you mine, oh)
Wrecking my balls, Miley
Making a storm, Kylie
Showing the fans I'm the only
Then clocking the wrist with the timing

[Bridge: KSI]
Doing it bless, doing it easy
Doing it best, doing it genie
I got the juice and I'll give you the world
Granting your wishes and doing it well
Let me know when you get freaky
Wanna see E.T.? Give you my number to bell
I got so many to choose
Which one you want? 'Cause I'm smitten and under your spell

[Verse 3: Craig David]
Tryna hold it down but enough's enough
I ain't really used to this thing called love
But I ain't afraid to admit I'm feeling so vulnerable
So whatever you decide, let me know what's the vibe
'Cause I'm losing my head tryna make you mine, oh

[Chorus: Craig David]
Is it really love? Is it all in my mind?
Is it crazy I think of you all of the time, baby?
Is it really love? Can you give me a sign?
'Cause I'm losing my head tryna make you mine
Is it really love? Is it all in my mind?
Is it crazy I think of you all of the time, baby?
Is it really love? Can you give me a sign?
'Cause I'm losing my head tryna make you mine, oh

[Intro: KSI]
Yo
You know you fucked up, bro
You know you fucked up
You know?
Tommy Gun shit

[Verse 1: KSI]
How much wood can the woodchuck chuck
If the woodchuck looked like you? (Bitch)
I'mma have fun, when the nigga here done
Yeah, the woodchuck would chuck none
Think you're a big man with a shrimp dick, man
I'ma click-click-clack (Bang)
I'ma tell 'em how I see it
The only bitch that I'll bitch slap, turn you into Riff Raff
Nigga, I'ma kill 'em with the red blade (YT)
Gotta lift the fat when you get laid
You a waste of time like a blunt blade
Em and your mum need my upgrade
L for days, I'm switching plays
I fuck with FaZe, the no-scope, then I hit and blaze
In the same room that we both know you can't afford
You need my shit so take the shit
Your contents shit, your Twitch is shit, your 'Gram is shit
I find it hella funny needing Cal to help save your shit
You really are a pussy (Shit)
Tell me, are you clean or bushy?
Don't fuck with you or that dumb one Ohio nigga
I took aim and I pulled the trigger
In the end tell me, who'll be bigger?
Yeah, yeah not you nigga, 'cause I'ma eight figure all time pro
Not at the top so you really don't know
Keep playing PUB', only game I see you winning as my enemy
The third degree, the guarantee, nah, you don't wanna battle me
'Cause I'mma leave you in the dirt like a sesame (Shit)
Brother, you are not ready
Top heavy prick with the potbelly, Rob Kelley, woah

[Pre-Chorus: KSI]
You think that the diss at your king is the wise thing to do while I'm feeding you? (Views)
I'ma keep calling you fat 'cause that's all of the shit that I see in you (Treadmill)
All six side boys hating 'cause this nigga was the man in the whole group (Damn)
Nigga in the room, writing words for the tomb, 'cause I come in with a six feet

[Chorus: KSI]
Earthquake, earthquake
Yeah, see a nigga move then earthquake, earthquake
Yeah, see a nigga lose then earthquake, earthquake
Game over
You ain't ready for business, you on the run, fitness

[Verse 2: RiceGum & KSI]
Are you fat or are you pregnant?
Like a mix of a dyke and a feminist
Fat rolls on your stomach and your neck and wrists
Cross-eyed Ron Weasley with the breasts and shit
Everyone in Sidemen is irrelevant
What views did you get before heaven sent
KSI drew your life? Let's measure it (That's none)
Y'all been his bitch ever since
How you-How you so fat, but your bank is not?
And you're living in the house JJ done bought
I'ma wait till your weight is lost
Gotta live with your boobs like Megan from Drake and Josh (Jesus)
All the titles is aimed for me
Another diss track trend that was made from me
PewDiePie fell off, it's a shame to see
Yeah, his views ain't the same, like he changed beliefs
Yeah, they always hate on me, I don't listen
I'm too busy getting laid, Hawaiian necklace
I don't want to talk about those Ohio bitches
Talk shit, but they soft like Brian Griffin (Ayy)
Pullin' up to my house, that's a no-no
Come again, you can get the action like a GoPro
Jake, how you get dropped from your own show?
Try so hard to ride the wave, like a rowboat (Chi)
But you gon' float, that's your girl? (Ugh)
Yeah, you cuffed the wrong one, like a dumb cop
Nick, come out the closet, why you wear that same shit every

[Bridge: KSI & RiceGum]
All these niggas thinking they can speak
Still, I'm making more than them a week
These pussies on contract
Don't bother trying or replying with a comeback

[Pre-Chorus: KSI]
You think that the diss at your king is the wise thing to do while I'm feeding you? (Views)
I'ma keep calling you fat 'cause that's all of the shit that I see in you (Treadmill)
All six side boys hating 'cause this nigga was the man in the whole group (damn)
Nigga in the room, writing words for the tomb, 'cause I come in with a six feet

[Chorus: KSI]
Earthquake, earthquake
Yeah, see a nigga move then earthquake, earthquake
Yeah, see a nigga lose then earthquake, earthquake
Game over
You ain't ready for business, you on the run, fitness

So, papi, tell me can you handle my type?
(Hell no, you don't know who you're fucking with)

[Verse 1: KSI]
Music, punching or the internet? I kill all of that
Twenty million when I see the net, I made all of that
Even when I'm ill I see a vet, I'm an animal
They know I'm eating up the threat like I'm Hannibal (Ayy, ayy, ah)
I got no reason to panic when all the money paid
Tailor-made, wearin' Armani now that I'm feelin' suede
Money-made, now I can choose the weather on any day (Ah, ah)
Anyway, king of the drama, killin' it everyday
Ooh, know you hiding 'cause you always throwback
Ooh, rolling through the pictures on the Kodak
Ooh, I'm the catch, saving like a goalie (Ooh)
Wishing but I know you fucking hate me (Ah)

Bad gyal with that look in her eye

[Verse 2: KSI]
You don't know who you're fucking with (Nah)
I know many come and go when I go to this (I know many)
Turn up into killer mode (Ayy), legacy fiddling
End another man and then I'm leaving him piddling
I'm a beast when I'm on it (Ah)
Hotter than your bonnet (Jeez)
I really want it like buffalo needing women (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Shreddin' it, disrespect and then I'm deading it (Nah, nah)
Repeating me winning the figure like I'm Benedict (Damn)
Got the money flowing proper like an ATM (Skrrt)
Gotta see me glowing proper with that alien (Skrrt, skrrt)
Taller than the Makkah when I gotta stack it up (Ayy)
Now she sounding like Chewbacca when she back it up (Err)

Hidden power, I'm on the come up, the boy like Atreus
All these people tweeting the unit and wanting to meet us
Truck hat, wear it, they call me the king like Aleus
I'm that weather they focus on
Still I always reign above the cynics and pour it on
Actin' like you tough, the bravado like Jason Bourne
Then coming out a pussy, Sticky Vicky from Benidorm

[Chorus: KSI]
Up all night, tryna see what's up all night
Wanna get a view of the fight
Lemme put you on a flight, cop you a new Rollie and the ice
When you fly as me, it's only right
She a bad lil' vibe, freaky with a booty on the side
Probably 'cause she wanna have the ride
Always get me high, wavy when I take these tides
Gotta make that water flow right

[Verse 1: KSI]
Body like water, can I take a sip? (Take a sip)
Gotta tell me when to roll, when you wanna trip (Wanna trip)
You wanna see me all the time like a Goldberg
Suffocating 'cause you kill it with a choker
Cold with the enemy, gold with the energy
Gotta just, check the sole of the heel like a Louis V
Bust a check on the dress of the Burberry
Break the neck when she walk, surgery
Always get alone, wanna bareback (Back, back)
She the only one I like when I tap that
Know you like it when I watch you like a TikTok
Got me flicking up and down 'til your ting pop
I be whipping in the limousine, movement make the body lean
Blacken all the window, shit, hiding all your dirty scenes
So sublime when she keep it lit (Keep it lit)
Maybe she's born with it, maybe it's Maybelline

[Chorus: KSI]
Up all night, tryna see what's up all night
Wanna get a view of the fight
Lemme put you on a flight, cop you a new Rollie and the ice
When you fly as me, it's only right
She a bad lil' vibe, freaky with a booty on the side
Probably 'cause she wanna have the ride
Always get me high, wavy when I take these tides
Gotta make that water flow right

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
Low ride
Water on the water on my necklace (Necklace)
Pressure when I hit it, then the next bitch (Next bitch)
I just dropped some water on that ho wrist (Ho wrist)
I can't do no cappin' and that's some ho shit (Woo)
Boy, I'm rich forever, ain't no broke shit (Ain't no broke shit)
That ass so fat, get the lotion
In that pussy, get control like a potion (Like a potion)
She gon' let me dive in it like the ocean (Like the ocean)
I done ran the check up, got the bag right (Bag right)
I had a pill, I can't remember last night (Last night)
I hop on the jet like it's my last flight (Last flight)
She gon' take the dick like it's her last pipe
Ooh (Ooh), Rollie on my wrist, that's cool (That's cool)
I might fuck her one time and make her boo (Make her boo)
Pull up just to drop the top on you (On you)
I've been ballin' on the game, no hoop (Rich!)

[Verse 3: AJ Tracey]
I'm in the dance and the mandem brought something in
Dutch hot pot, we ain't got no mutton in
You got a 'Rari body, and I ain't stuttering
Breadwinner girls so come here and get a butterin'
Broski Nike Teched Up, big cuttering
I'm from the Grove, so baby, I brought another in
You coolin' over there, his bucket ain't got nothin' in it
We bussin' out the bottles, so come here, you lot are suffering
I got money, but it's bait, babe, you know that
I was layin' in the mud, ain't tryna go back
And I'm still the same nigga from the throwback
I just stay around the gators like I'm Kodak
See, I came in with KSI, lookin' in the haters eye
When I was young, I did some wrong, I'm tryna make it right
Too many people in my head right now
Let me go grab the bag and go to bed right now

[Chorus: KSI]
Up all night, tryna see what's up all night
Wanna get a view of the fight
Lemme put you on a flight, cop you a new Rollie and the ice
When you fly as me, it's only right
She a bad lil' vibe, freaky with a booty on the side
Probably 'cause she wanna have the ride
Always get me high, wavy when I take these tides
Gotta make that water flow right

[Intro: Future & KSI]
Oh, yeah, yeah

Gi-gi

[Verse 1: Future & KSI]
Hit me on my burner, hit me on my burner, ayy
All we know is murder, all we know is murder
It's goin' down in my hood
They shoot rounds in my hood, they shoot rounds in my hood (Lovely)
Tears in your eyes, on your mama cheek (Mama cheek)
Bloodstains dryin' on the concrete
Yeah, we be like, "Fuckin' all that Twitter shit"
All my niggas militant, take a hit for benefit (Gi-gi)
And I'm fuckin' all the witnesses
These stripper bitches ain't gon' say shit
Ayy, that's an unsolved freak (Freaky, freaky)
Have mеrcy on a G (Woo)

[Chorus: KSI]
Whole gang up, all my brothers lit (True)
Racks on racks, ain't too much to spеnd (Never waiting)
Old come through when they wanna lend (See they with the)
New chain chillin' and it got a twin
Ah, ooh (Yeah, yeah)
Where were you when I was down?
Where were you? (Where were you?)
Guess who is the shit now, number two (Look at you)
In the circus you a clown, look at you (You)
Bringing views (Ah) 

[Verse 2: KSI]
I pick what I want then I cop, cop
That shit you dropped just gon' flop, flop
When the future is present, we pop off
Then tell me how can I drop off? (Yeah)
Their demeanour is fugazi
When you reach my level, my many medals seem lazy (Brr)
Plaque after plaque while the industry's on my back
19 on my wrist so I'm roaming it with a pack
I got runners on the ándale
They go to West whenever packin' for the holidays
Been dodging Judas since the time he kissed my money gone
Been gettin' boomers since the mainstream got their focus on
The focus' number one

[Verse 3: 21 Savage]
Never follow rules, I was skippin' school (21)
You know I ain't friendly, so quit actin' like we cool (Pussy)
Spin them niggas block 'cause we have nothin' else to do (21)
Ain't trippin' 'bout no bitch, you know I'm a player, I tie my shoes (On God)
All my diamonds hit up (21)
Wet your block in a pick up (21)
All-all my cars they go fast, face ain't shit but I like her ass
I don't love her but I love my cash, COVID-19, I'm wearin' my mask
You know I'm out here thuggin', so suck me like you love me (Facts)
Last opp played with us, we turned his ass duppy (Whack)
I'm a big dog and I love to step on puppy (21)
Two-tone Maybach, same color, Kentucky (21)

[Chorus: KSI]
Whole gang up, all my brothers lit
Racks on racks, ain't too much to spend
Old come through when they wanna lend
New chain chillin' and it got a twin
Ah, ooh (Yeah, yeah)
Where were you when I was down?
Where were you? (Where were you?)
Guess who is the shit now, number two (Look at you)
In the circus you a clown, look at you (You)
Bringing views (Ah)

[Chorus]
Just hopped out the bank, I'm rollin'
Pockets swollen, it's my year (Oh, yeah)
And I am the one who's chosen
Neck, wrist, frozen, I don't care (Yeah)
I enter the room, I'm glowing
No strings holding, mans gone clear (Ooh)
I'm comin' to own like Romans
This my moment, zero fear

[Verse 1]
Oh my God, I feel amazing (Oh)
Running up the numbers with my feed (With my feed)
My disease is going viral (Oh)
Yeah, trust me, I'm a sicko when we meet (When I see you)
Beefin' like it's thirteen thirty-seven
Now they know that if I enter, I'm elite (I'm on top, man)
And I like it when it's cold (So cold)
Rocky diamonds at it ASAP

[Chorus]
Just hopped out the bank, I'm rollin'
Pockets swollen, it's my year (Oh, yeah)
And I am the one who's chosen
Neck, wrist, frozen, I don't care (Yeah)
I enter the room, I'm glowing
No strings holding, mans gone clear (Ooh)
I'm comin' to own like Romans
This my moment, zero fear

[Verse 2]
Yeah, situated in my own lane
I'm not in it for the one time
Snowpiercer, my train
Always on the go
My shit so cold, I'm Eskimo
I need an igloo for my shindu and then add a double O
Show me the money 'cause I'm not a liar (No)
I'm on my Jerry Maguire (What?)
I'm on the up like a wheelie
Shakin' when comin' to see me
My team all over the map
Livin' and givin' and doin' it freely (On the map)
You man are full of the cap
I'm so ahead like I'm wearin' a beanie (Ayy, ayy)

[Bridge]
Love it, karma, private charter
Movin' easy, losin' nada
She hate all the money I waste
Still wrappin' a brick in a lace
She likin' the way that I'm potent
Ridin' the ting like it's Alton
And she'll ride again

[Chorus]
Just hopped out the bank, I'm rollin'
Pockets swollen, it's my year (Oh)
And I am the one who's chosen
Neck, wrist, frozen, I don't care (Yeah)
I enter the room, I'm glowing
No strings holding, mans gone clear (Gone clear)
I'm comin' to own like Romans
This my moment, zero fear

[Chorus: Deno]
Bad bad
Back of them jeans, looking mad mad
Open the Jeep, let me grab grab
Roll with the G's, that's the gang
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Someone told me she's a liar
Never gonna cap, I need a rider
Told you 'don't play with fire'
Gang gang, stop playing with the gang gang

[Verse 1: KSI]
Come every year like Mariah (Hmm)
Five figure drip when I show the attire
No stress, I'm in control like I'm Isco
Won't be no dancing if man let the diss go
Trust me, it's long when they aim at me (Jeez)
Same chain, but it ain't the same as me (Nah)
Thinking you're king, I'll dismantle thе throne that you're on
Leavе you there looking like Kong (Hahaha)
But I ain't on a funny man ting
I just stack mills, kick back, money man ting
Half a billy when they stream my ting
Lights blinding when they pree my ring

[Chorus: Deno]
Bad bad
Back of them jeans, looking mad mad (Jeans)
Open the Jeep, let me grab grab (Jeep)
Roll with the G's, that's the gang (G's)
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Someone told me she's a liar (Liar)
Never gonna cap, I need a rider (Rider)
Told you 'don't play with fire' (Fire)
Gang gang, stop playing with the gang gang

[Verse 2: JAY1, Deno & JAY1]
Big jacket, my G savage, he been active
JAY poppin' I stay guappin', there's no slackin' (nope)
Stay rapping, I live lavish, I got fashion (flash)
That girl's got a big back of the cheeks clappin'
The way she's throwing it back
All the baddies wanna link me
Nah, I'm clocking the cash
I just pulled up in a mazza, now she's flashing her racks
And I've just got a couple bookers, man pull up with the gang
We get turnt up (Turnt)
Told the baddie in the room to come twerk up (Twerk)
Told my nigga come we bill it and burn up (Burn)
Big money in the bank, 'cah I'm a earner
Wave, I'm a surfer

[Chorus: GRACEY]
I don't worry 'bout you
You say you don't fuck with me
But my name's on the tip of your tongue (Mhm)
And that's on you, baby
You, baby
I don't think about you
Yet I'm in your head rent-free
Why's my name on the tip of your tongue?
That's on you, baby
You-you baby

[Verse 1: KSI]
Living in the city 'cause I wanna (Yeah)
Tippin many drivers in the city with a hunna (Woo)
Quarantine won't stop me in the city I'm a runner (Nah)
Strava with a 5K under twenty-two when I fly away (Jeez)
Pink Vaporfly when I zoom
Eight figure net if I enter any room
Any tune that I'm hoppin' on is gonna Sonic Boom
And now my phone is ringin'
Hit me out the blue but then I never give an F
Black and white, I keep it true, don't try me like a ref (Damn)
Mixin' with the cutter in my own kitchen with a chef (Mm)
Help so many people that they call me UNICEF
All that beggin' for the recipe
Son of a man that's been workin' the hardest
To passing out the energy, they pissin' on my enemies
No stress over here, bossin' in my Moncler, nigga

[Chorus: GRACEY]
I don't worry 'bout you
You say you don't fuck with me (You don't fuck with me)
But my name's on the tip of your tongue
And that's on you, baby (That's on you, baby)
You, baby
I don't think about you
Yet I'm in your head rent-free
Why's my name on the tip of your tongue? (The tip of your tongue)
That's on you, baby
You-you baby

[Verse 2: KSI]
And I'm livin' rent free
Big bangers comin' from the ego theory
Callin' Charlie just to spend it on his jewellery
Now I'm showin' it off 'cause I'm unruly
Man's in everything like a neutron
And I keep on winnin' even when I do wrong
Too strong (Woo)
Winnin' with my winners but it's too long
Still I come with a drip so fresh that they all wanna tweak
Lookin' at a Tory like I paid for the meat
Lookin' at the catalogue paid for the beef
Lookin' at the analogue paid for the grief
I'm a real bad man if you're on the wrong side
Got bare space for that piggy back ride
If I want it I get it (Yeah)
Never regret it (Yeah)
If I go dyin', I'm dyin' in credit, ah

[Bridge: GRACEY]
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, yeah
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, yeah
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, yeah
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, yeah
Mm-mm, yeah (Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, yeah)
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus: GRACEY]
I don't worry 'bout you
You say you don't fuck with me (You don't fuck with me, baby)
But my name's on the tip of your tongue
And that's on you, baby (That's on you, that's on you, baby)
You, baby
I don't think about you
Yet I'm in your head rent-free
Why's my name on the tip of your tongue?
That's on you, baby (That's on you, that's on you, baby)
You-you baby

[Outro: GRACEY]
Mm-mm, mm-mm, yeah, ayy
Yeah, mm, yeah-ayy
Ah-mm
Mm-mm-mm

[Chorus]
Madness, know that when you at this
Grandness, grab it like I'm Atlas
Always want when they pree it, can't believe when they see it
I've been here for a minute, motorway with no limit
Madness, know that when you at this
Grandness, big name on campus
I'm the proof in that pudding
Say they can but they couldn't (Nahh)
I'm the man when I'm in it (Mmm)
I'll be done when I'm finished

[Verse 1]
Don't piss me off
I've been killin' this shit
Acting tough on the net with their feminine clits, bitch, you're gonna get hit
And I've done more than the most in a single yеar and still I'm the YouTube Don
I got clowned for thе way that I was on the net and still I'm the man that won
Now they're chasing me, chasing the hype
Wanting me, wanting the life
Loving me, loving the type
So I gave her pipe
Taking advantage, more venom in than carnage
A lot of choice like I'm Target
Only one in my market
Want a piece and I'll charge it
I'm at a point where I buy shit now just to rap about it
Post anything and they speak about it
Type anything and they tweet about it
Do anything and they meme about it
Only man with a life like me
Still unleashing with the jet like Li
Still achieving all the goals round me
Pick of the bunch and I'm still O.P

[Chorus]
Madness, know that when you at this
Grandness, grab it like I'm Atlas
Always want when they pree it, can't believe when they see it
I've been here for a minute, motorway with no limit
Madness, know that when you at this
Grandness, big name on campus
I'm the proof in that pudding
Say they can but they couldn't (Nahh)
I'm the man when I'm in it (Mmm)
I'll be done when I'm finished

[Verse 2]
But I'm not finished
I've been sick for the longest time and I'm still on top so I'm the illest
I've gone clear with the strongest power of my own OC so I'm the realest
Bring that heat with the hiss of the human torch so the team know that I am the littest
Saying I need a feature now they feature me
Never charting now it's easily
Back the beef and now I drink the tea
6 figures now it's for the fee
Up the levels from a Lamborghini
Bringing wishes cause the man a genie
Everything I touch a mazaline
Still, you wonder why they wanna be me
Big boy tings, everything I spit is facts
End of the moment, but mans gonna come back like a Tekken Jet

[Chorus]
Madness, know that when you at this
Grandness, grab it like I'm Atlas
Always want when they pree it, can't believe when they see it
I've been here for a minute, motorway with no limit (Jesus Christ!)
Madness, know that when you at this
Grandness, big name on campus
I'm the proof in that pudding
Say they can but they couldn't (Nahh)
I'm the man when I'm in it (Mmm)
I'll be done when I'm finished

[Verse 1: KSI]
Sometimes I think this world's a simulation
The way that certain things just happen with no explanation
Just like the time I went to go to tell my mum I'm quitting school
She laughed at me and said that this is just an April Fool
Sorry mum, but I'm for real (For real)
I'm done with living our poor life, there's just a bigger deal (Deal)
I'm way too old for you to beat me (Nah)
I just want you to treat me like a person with a choice (Choice)
Now for my decisions, I'm a person with a voice

[Chorus: S-X]
Now I'm hitting a wall
And it all comes apart
See a light in the dark
And it's blinding my eyes, oh
Now I feel like someone's watchin' me (Yеah)
And someone elsе is watchin' them
And I'm sleepin' with the enemy, yeah
Acting like they were my friend

[Verse 2: KSI]
It's never easy on the road
Shut down many times, I've been alone
Cry, I'm fully grown
I'm overloaded with emotions
Overwhelming with emotions with a view
This is just a movie with a crew
I hate when overthinking makes me wanna find a new
Or when the people find ​a reason just to hate on you
I came with nothing on me, I'll leave with nothing on me
I guess the time that's in between is for the viewin' only

Alright, this is the last time I'm doing this shit with you

Sitting at the top, viewing triple six
Devil with the flow, with the crucifix


[Chorus: KSI]
Two birds, one stone (ye)
Two birds with the one stone (ye, ye)
Two birds, one stone
Two birds with the one stone (one stone)

Tell me how my dick ended up in your main chick
Threesome with the hoe, double trouble, don't ever say shit
Bouncing in the bed while they swallow up all my brain kids
Popeye in the opposite hearing them from my cockpit (damn)
Your music, fam, it's so lame (uh)
Rapping about a kitty, are you braindead? (haha)
We don't wanna hear another house track (nah, nah)
Your music makes me wanna pop a Prozac (damn)
But you're always on it (damn!)
Especially when your most viewed music vid has this nigga on it (haha, haha)
God-damn, unstable little cunt don't know what to do
Guess he'll make a book too, sobbing to promote too
Whispering "Joe" for haunted bullshit
Who the hell would wanna go buy your book of bullshit?
Filming all your dead tunes with Elliot
One week break? You're a legitimate idiot
Tweeting that you'll knock me out, just like Theo, huh?
Yeah, black-facing prick wanna be me, huh?
Yeah, begging to think that you're gon' beat me, huh?
Yeah, Popeye the prick, now regret it, huh

Lying to your mama
Guess I gotta add some Kerosene to the drama (ay)
When she hears the whole of the verse, she's gonna jet (ay)
Especially when she hears me tell her that you're doing Ket, man
I don't wanna be that type of dude blurting all of your business
Know that you're the one that started this
The Lord is my witness
Guess he saw that time in Pascha when you paid for that BJ
Then the prozzy bruised your dick
Now you're scared of them BJs, hey
Now you're getting pegged
Got these little kids looking up the shit I said (damn)
You a bitch boy, I don't care if you're rich, boy
Degrading cause Ezekiel robbed your shit, boy
Nissan GTR with your coin money (coin money)
Snaking all of your boys just for more money (more money)
You're a dodgy prick, let that settle in (D-amn)
Blood-boiling bars, let that kettle sing (god-damn)
Your balls online, that's unsettling (Jesus!)
With the DM telling me, you're too pussy fighting me
Cause you know you'll lose to me
Little boy is getting slapped up
You fucked up when you aimed at me (trip, trip)

Popeye wanna pop at the elegant (elegant)
Plus the little boy wanna play again (play again)
Sitting at the top, viewing triple six (triple, triple)
Devil with the flow, with the crucifix (crucifix)

Two birds, one stone (uh, uh)

Harry, you're a lying cunt, fuck yourself bruh

"New Age"

Yeah, they can't hold us back, we on another level (level)
Yeah, this that new age, ain't it somethin' special? (special)
Yeah, we gon' change the game, we gon' live forever (never die)
Yeah, it's that new age, it's that new age

This is the new age (uh)
Now they wanna play 'cause they tryna get paid
But they can't 'cause they're too late
We got stacks, already makin' it rain (rain)
They can't afford us now
Jump on the jet, switchin' borders now
Wrote me off when I was seventeen
Fast forward, they're my employees now
Welcome to the fuckin' future
This that life that I'm gettin' used to
I'm doing whatever I choose to
Fake friends that we'll never lose to
I ain't bowing to a briefcase
I'm on the run, that's a speed chase
New livin', it's that new phase
Already begun, it's that new age

Yeah, they can't hold us back, we on another level (level)
Yeah, this that new age, ain't it somethin' special? (special)
Yeah, we gon' change the game, we gon' live forever (never die)
Yeah, it's that new age, it's that new age

Fuck you
Big boy with that big brew
Big boy how I come through
Big boy with that brand new
'Cause I'm killin' it
Going baloney, my rollie's so holy
Trophy, I go Kobe, go stoney Mick Foley
Tobi my homie, no phoney to show me
I am a legend; Broly
You're looking timorous
Don't get close to the star like you're Icarus
I'm impulsive with shit that I'm dealing with
I go fucking berserk when I'm hearin' this
I'm so canny with the flow
Makin' money on the go
Girls around me wanna three
Two girls lickin' on the D
I'm the one to really be
This is a madness
This is a madness
I'm kicking the door off the hinge
This is the new age and I am the pioneer
See them bracin' with that riot gear
Motherfucker, I'm over this
I'm here making the moves that take over this
I drink Baileys, don't care if your polar this
I'm no Milli Vanilli, I'm Fiddy when he was the king of his city
Not here to be pretty, no
Mandem where ever this nigga go
Change up the move with my auraglow
Bust up the shield, the Wakanda switch (ah)
Marvel moves on that L.A. bitch (ah)
See no passin', CDM
New Age Don
Know that I'm never gone
Know that I'm never gone

"Not Over Yet (Remix)"
(feat. Headie One & Nines)

Tell me why you startin' a fire?
It's burnin' up in my head
Why do I always tell myself that it's not over yet?
Why you gotta tear my heart out?
Leave me in the rain
Why do I always tell myself that it's not over yet?

I still got all of this beef, but no french fries
Even if I die, we can continue in the next life
My neck over a hundred K, no SIs (Bling)
The rappers can't go back to their block, the boy banned like Westlife
I done a night shift with a fucked up life switch
Grindin', I had a non-existent sex life (Uh)
And win all your real wars within a square mile
You thought you needed crocodile teeth, when I'm from the reptile (It's not over yet)
I keep comin' back, it's not over yet (No)
I can ice skate, on this Audermars Piguet
Jakes think I'm washing up this money, like a laundrette
Real niggas come from the trap, and try to turn the block corporate
Imagine us white collar, and still gets bi-polar, we still walk with it
I got the weight on my shoulders, distribute this bread
Like the Passover, eatin' uptown in some Yves Saint Laurent loafers

[Chorus: KSI]
Tell me why you startin' a fire?
It's burnin' up in my head
Why do I always tell myself that it's not over yet?
Why you gotta tear my heart out?
Leave me in the rain
Why do I always tell myself that it's not over yet? (Uh)

It's Nino with a Nina, should be in 'rena
How the fuck I end up being a wing cleaner?
I'ma, I'ma big dreamer
Mum told me stop hanging with them gangsters
She don't know I was the ringleader
Puttin' work in, you was with a chick
They was watchin' Nick Jr., I was a junior gettin' nic' (Junior gettin' nic)
2017, you woulda saw me with a junkie
C-C-Came outta jail, started tourin' 'round the country (It's not over yet)
While the pro niggas reminisce (Uh)
My new movie's comin' out soon
I just shot the pilot like a terrorist
They think that I'm back on my grind, but I'm focused
Like The Matrix the plugs in the back of my mind (Focused)
And hold all kinds of grudges, they gotta stream the boxing while I'm one row behind the judges (Frank Lucas)
Ice City, KSI, and my money still lonely, nigga, FYI


[Pre-Chorus: KSI]
Tell me why you startin' a fire?
It's burnin' up in my head
Why do I always tell myself that it's not over yet?
Why you gotta tear my heart out?

[Outro]
Leave me in the rain
Why do I always tell myself that it's not over yet?


"THE RACIST REPLIES"

Rucka Rucka (Who?)
Please go drown and shut up
Every Google image looking like you taking dick up
I've sold more than all your albums, all with just an EP
How's it feel to know a Tuber's killing you? I'm OP

Racist pagan with shit music, why'd you even sell it?
No-one wants to hear a deformed Joseph Gordon-Levitt
Nigga please you're irrelevant
I'm the one to make you relevant
Arrogant asshole got me hoping you get fucked by an elephant

[Pre-Chorus: KSI]
I'm done here trying to fake this peace
Too much noise when I take my keys
Lamborghini for the furniture
Your shitty vids are so amateur
Dog-eat-dog and a Michael Vikk
Break your face with a falcon kick
I'ma savage, yeah you know that now
Tiny man taking L's right now

[Chorus: KSI]
Suck your mum you stupid racist boring piece of shit
Take these L's and shove it up where you release the shitty words you spit
Black man ending it, your career, I'ma make you go vegan
Nah we ain't even
Rucka Rucka alleyoop
Beaten

"Low"

I'm feeling low
Yeah, they tell me I'm blessed, should be counting my blessings
Low
Keep it all in my head, I'm not good at impressions
Low
And I feel a bit lost, I'm not learning my lesson
Low, I'm feeling low

I'm so high, I'm so high when I'm fadin'
Tryna kick you out of my mind, but I'm failin'
They keep on comin' up to tell me that I made it
Now I'm feeling guilty and I don't know how to fake it
I get below the bar that you've set
I get more stressed the closer we get
My life is drifting over my head
When all the lights are low, I regress and

I'm trying to figure it out
And get away from the doubt
Wish you could understand the feelings that I'm talking about
Outside, it looks like I'm on top of everything I put out
But I'm feeling

I'm feeling low (Low)
Yeah, they tell me I'm blessed, should be counting my blessings
Low (Low)
Keep it all in my head, I'm not good at impressions
Low (Low)
And I feel a bit lost, I'm not learning my lesson
Low, I'm feeling low

[Chorus: S-x]
I don't know, I'm just sick of this
Always undecided when I reminisce
Think I'm in control, but I'm
Powerless to things that they need
Over and over, but I can never take the lead
I'm stressin' to make it real
I'm stressin' to always feel
I'm stressin' to help the people when I'm the one that's in need
I say it, but no one hears
But given light when they see you in chandeliers, still

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm trying to figure it out
And get away from the doubt
Wish you could understand the feelings that I'm talking about
Outside, it looks like I'm on top of everything I put out
But I'm feeling

I'm feeling low (Low)
Yeah, they tell me I'm blessed, should be counting my blessings
Low (Low)
Keep it all in my head, I'm not good at impressions
Low (Low)
And I feel a bit lost, I'm not learning my lesson
Low, I'm feeling low

Woo-ooh, woo-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

I try to hide
The pain you put me through
I tell myself it's fine
Another one night stand will do
I'm turnin' off the light so it's dark inside my room
And then I close my eyes, pretendin' that it's you
I wish my memory was deleted
My heart's in a hundred pieces
In my head I hear you screamin'
It wakes me while I'm sleepin'

Now I'm laying in bed and I'm without you
And I can't stop dreaming about you
Wanna close my eyes and watch us drift away (Oh, yeah)

[Chorus]
I let go
Every time I hear those (Hear those voices)
Voices in my head, my head (Oo-oo)
I run home (I run home)

You're not with me now
Drowning, midnight skies
I didn't bring you here to cry (Bring you here to cry)
No (Woah-ooh)
Was it all a lie? (All a lie, yeah, yeah)

Or am I trippin', just in my head?
Should I just try to stay right here with you? (Here with you)
Oh, oh-oh

Oh, I get locked out, oh, I get locked out
I really loved you, wow

Oh, I get locked out, oh, I get locked out

I'm so over this right now
Got a lot to say when I'm knocked down
Don't wanna hear that you've been beamin'
'Cause I've been out here fighting demons
Really tryna hide what I'm goin' through
Insta pics with a lying view
Really wanna say that I'm missin' you
'Cause I've been out here failing too
I'm not over you right now
Got a lot to say if you came 'round

Easy, do it with no effort when I make it look easy
You gotta respect a man, respect me when you see me
Hope you get the message, get the message like it's 3D
That shit is hard but I make it look easy

Stepper, big stepper

Turnt so high, can't shut me off
Oh, so loud, can't hear you talk
Rep up (Ayy, yeah), will you rep up? (Ayy, yeah)

Now I really work, work, work, I think I'm RiRi
I was on the wing phonin' home like I was ET
Now I'm on the TV and I really make these hatin' niggas wanna be me
When I get frustrated, they'll just have to make it bleed bleed
'Cause I don't give a fuck, I'm goin' hard, I think I'm concrete
I'm tryna die a legend, yeah, I really think I'm Kobe
Them man think they're on smoke, they don't know it's smokey
They don't know we're really 'bout this life, you're talkin' OGs
They don't know we really count it twice, we came from no peace
And we came up lowkey, until we hit the lime light
First we bought a Rolex, now the whole chest is just ice ice
And it's a no contest, I'm on a don flex, I'm like Iron Mike
If I hit him with a left-right, then it's night night
It's light work, I swear I make it look

Easy, do it with no effort when I make it look easy
You gotta respect a man, respect me when you see me (When you see me)
Hope you get the message, get the message like it's 3D
That shit is hard but I make it look easy (But I make it look)

When you see me
But I make it look

Surrounded by the same motherfuckers from my hood, I'm good

I'm changin' views, there's nothing you can do
And I believe in my crew

Believe me, I see through a lot of fake love, yeah
But I'ma let it go because it really ain't a thing to me, yeah (Ch, cha)

"Night To Remember"
(feat. Randolph & S-X)

Oh yeah, we just shut the whole club down
A hundred bottles doesn't feel like enough now
And your girl said she ain't seen nothing like this, no
Then we just fade into the night (yeah)
Yeah, we just faded in the night (yeah)
She just want a night to remember
I told her something that she likes
I said she's leaving here with me, yeah

Yeah, duplex living while counting riches (money)
Every time we enter, astonishing taking pictures
Never praying though while my Momma keep reading scriptures (yeah)
Sorry, but who else gon' be caring for all these strippers?
I'm puking in Gucci slippers (ayy)
Drinking that Fiji water (ayy)
Texting my sexy PA (ayy)
Made sure my things in order (ahhh)
Jetting through all these borders
I buss down like Neptune
Paco Rabanne, my odour
So Millions is how I'm smelling
I love it when they're complaining
Dont fuck with those that settle (nah)
Invite me to your shit, but I don't give a fuck about medals (nah)
Watching them backpedal, my level is never zero (never)
Reaping all my sewing and all of you niggas knowin'
Cause I'm malady
Better living with the family
Blood type, no type, all types
Shit, it's all fine with me
Champagne spraying all on my table (shhh)
Party life is my label (shhh)
Cutting out all this drama
And killing this Cain and Abel shit

Oh yeah, we just shut the whole club down
A hundred bottles doesn't feel like enough now
And your girl said she ain't seen nothing like this, no
Then we just fade into the night (yeah)
Yeah, we just faded in the night (yeah)
She just want a night to remember
I told her something that she likes
I said she's leaving here with me, yeah

Rollie, rollie, rollie, rollie, I got four of them
On the road these groupies calling, I'm ignoring them
No paper chase, no camera roll, manually storing 'em
Poppin' champagne, shit be filling like a water gun
Another city every night, that we shutdown
She got stars in her eyes from that buss down
The universe up on my wrist, don't give a fuck now
She ain't never seen nothing like that
Fuck your past, let me rewrite that
I can change your life and be right back
Let me hear it talk, hear that bite back
Take that pussy for a walk in the air
She can have the night back
Motherfuck a night cap
Buy the whole bar, I'll motherfuck the price tag
Stack the money tall, I ain't even playing
So influential, when I ball I ain't paying

Oh yeah, we just shut the whole club down
A hundred bottles doesn't feel like enough now
And your girl said she ain't seen nothing like this, no
Then we just fade into the night (yeah)
Yeah, we just faded in the night (yeah)
She just want a night to remember
I told her something that she likes
I said she's leaving here with me, yeah, yeah

"How It Feel"

You the best, how it feel
Skrrr

You the best, how it feel
How you woke up lookin' like you got a Olay poppin' deal?
Cool
Love to celebrate the gang and never running out of cheers
If they don't hate us when we winnin', baby, you know what we do
Long way from the bottom, baby, this is how it feel

Wearin' the new, piss in the loo
Polish the V's, now makin' a zute
Whenever you near me, I'm poppin' off
Eatin' so good, then we burn it off
Swipin', I'm part of the A Team
When you take it to face it get more clean
I know, I know now
Too much I know
Presidential now froze like ice, don't stand way too close
And I really don't lose, no joke
I really hope you forgive that I boast
It's really hard not to say when you chosen
Pour the drink and we toastin'

You the best, how it feel
How you woke up lookin' like you got a Olay poppin' deal?
Cool
Love to celebrate the gang and never running out of cheers
If they don't hate us when we winnin', baby, you know what we do
Long way from the bottom, baby, this is how it feel

Yeah, coolin' the heat at my property, make it now
Got a new track that I'm feelin' now
Maybe a 'Rari to hit the town
Takin' a ride-ride with the top down on the road
Takin' it my time in the right line when I go
Tell me how you really feel
See you lookin' now, believin', boy, you keep it chill
I see all the other women, cold enough to spill
Still I got the option there to kill

You the best, how it feel
How you woke up lookin' like you got a Olay poppin' deal?
Cool
Love to celebrate the gang and never running out of cheers
If they don't hate us when we winnin', baby, you know what we do
Long way from the bottom, baby, this is how it feel

"Cap"
(feat. Offset)

(Go Grizz)
(Molly Made)

I cannot pretend if I don't
I can tell the fake from the fraud
Out here checking chips for the bank
That's why I can't be no friends with no cap

With no cap, with no cap, with no cap
With no cap, with no cap, with no cap
With no cap, with no cap, with no cap
With no cap, bitch, that's cap

Fuck up the city
My bitch she bad and she did it
Put the Patek on her arm, she litty
Ice, ice cold, cold, frigid
I was on the road, kilo, tryna get it
I will not sell my soul for a billion
Drop Mulsanne, gotcha main man
Ridin' through the city when I fuck with the gang
Shawty got stuck with the gang
Bent the ben, take her when you pullin' up, range
These niggas cap, they lame
I'ma put the AP on, make it rain
She bad, she a animal, get tamed
Pouring up the mud in the Fanta drank
Homes, you a dud I'ma hit you with the flame
Took these hoes, Offset and the gang
These niggas broke, oh shame oh shame
Bust my neck, my wrist, my frames
Bust yo bitch, give the rest to the gang
Bust my clip, fuck a vest I got aim
Fuck nigga talkin' on Twitter say your name
I'ma pay ten rack, they gon' get your brain
Ridin' in the Benz Maybach, what's your name?
I'ma drip, drip Gucci down, Gucci 'caine

I cannot pretend if I don't
I can tell the fake from the fraud
Out here checking chips for the bank
That's why I can't be no friends with no cap

[pre-Chorus]
With no cap, with no cap, with no cap
With no cap, with no cap, with no cap
With no cap, with no cap, with no cap
With no cap, bitch, that's cap

Cooling a bitch tryna find me
My bread, that shit cookin' is grimey
The product they're selling like pallets
My putty, I glue it like Pritt Stick
Payin' the crystal for surfing
Catchin' a wave, nigga fishin'
People hissin', cuttin' their hands in the kitchen
Snakey slimes, they sell out a mate for dimes
Pay 200k for rhymes, I get 200k for the views
I paid 500k for a cat
I got 500k for that river
Niggas on different cheddar
Fuck around with that blue cheese and that mozzarella
Edit the show, got my blue trees
Open the garden with few keys
Hellen Keller, one show and they panic
I don't stop winnin', I swear I'm an addict
Automatic, competition is viewless
Cinematic when I kill it like Kula
They go manic, they don't win, I'm in it
Overtime when I dunkin' the cynic

[Chorus]
I cannot pretend if I don't
I can tell the fake from the fraud
Out here checking chips for the bank
That's why I can't be no friends with no cap

[Outro]
With no cap, with no cap, with no cap
With no cap, with no cap, with no cap
With no cap, with no cap, with no cap
With no cap, bitch, that's cap

"Uncontrollable"
(feat. Big Zuu)

[KSI:]
Yeah, yeah
Mmm, yeah

Lit it up, I'm the one that's feeling on fire (it's lit)
Live it up, looking at my G, we go higher
I earned the whole shit, hope you're hearing that
Come at man and I'll make a man go
Flowing my riches, making wishes
For all these bitches, yeah
Haters so vicious, making riches
In all these cities, yeah
Hate going shopping, people popping
For all these pictures, yeah
Say that I'm flopping, still you copping
So why you knocking at my door?
I don't care about what you wanna do, I just ignore
You can't keep on charging like a bull, I'm at the door
I'ma dress up how I fucking like, it's my decor
I'ma fuck up how I fucking like (wait)
Nigga I'm independent, no-one talking that condescending
Say that my time is ending, still I kill it and go and send it
I'm in control, doing shit you don't know
I'm ascending, living, winning, moving like I'm J Cole (and)

I can do what I want, I can do what I want (mmm)
I can do what I want and no-one, no-one here stopping me (na)
No-one, no-one here stopping me (na)

Gotta let them know I'm uncontrollable
I'm ruling when they roll with me
I done let them know I'm uncontrollable
Being who I wanna be (yeah, yeah)
No way, no way, no way, no way, no way, you're controlling me
No way, no way, no way, no way, no way, you're not owning me
I don't wanna know, I'm here with the dough
Counting all the blessings and I live it all fo' sho'

[Big Zuu:]
Yo, see I'm something that you can't control
They don't want to see me mad, that they can't control
I make moves and tell my accountant roll
I ain't part of the system, I can't enrol
Said I'm due to blow, like when the blast implodes
From the inside out, man I keep it real
I can tell that they're fake, but I can't expose
And I've got that drive, I don't need the gas
Man I'm something like the cars that charge on road
I'm in hearts, I'm in master mode
Hustler by nature, can't you hear my grafter tone?
Won't stop 'til the shard's my home
It's the b-i-g, man are bigger than a barge
Man talk bad and they're getting on my nerves
They used to say reason with the work
Man I done [?] before I'm getting from my verse
I bet they're all regretting all their words
Try war man, I'll send him in a herse
From a ends where bruddas bust weapons and they skr
Said I see it as a blessing and a curse
It made me diverse when I've been through worse
But now they can't fuck with the plans
Man are happy where I am now I'm finishing first
Yeah, and I'm making moves
I don't care for hating zuu
I'll start hotting up kids like real quick start blazing youtes
You'll see bare gun fingers but there won't be no raving crew
Man have been one of the best, I can't lie, it's the blatant truth
And I can show them evidence
It's black and white like the change of presidents
Man are big 'ere like the side of elephants
You're talking bare with your big mouth
You sound like a bird you pelican
I don't really care about relevance
Like if they don't know then I'm telling them
I'll put their favourite emcee in the grave and bury them
Guess what I've got accumulating
Send shots to any crew that's hating
Flex gods, MTP formation
Walk in the rave, we don't need no creditation
I don't really care about the pagans
I can see the devils in their words
It's a man who they're demonstrating
Oh you didn't catch that bar?
Well guess what, that's 'cause I'm steps ahead
I don't play with dough but still I stretch the bread
Like, tryna get the full package
Like the back's nice but the breasts are dead
Couple park guys but the rest are dreds
That I take your girl, that's once she left your bed
And now you're vexed and stressed
Man are breaking hearts so protect your chest, like

[KSI:]
I can do what I want, I can do what I want (mmm)
I can do what I want and no-one, no-one here stopping me
No-one, no-one here stopping me

Gotta let them know I'm uncontrollable
I'm ruling when they roll with me
I done let them know I'm uncontrollable
Being who I wanna be (yeah, yeah)
No way, no way, no way, no way, no way, you're controlling me
No way, no way, no way, no way, no way, you're not owning me

[Outro]
I don't wanna know, I'm here with the dough
Counting all the blessings and I live it all fo' sho'

S-o-l-o, I don't need a feat
I'm OP, man, I don't need to cheat

Man, I'm on a roll
Throw it in the air, cause a lady on a pole
Showing off their asses, got her brothers saying wow
Said she had no pants on, brother she a hoe, oh
I don't know how we did this shit alone
Not so long ago, had my people on the phone
Talk about the past while we're hidden in cologne
Mushy, mushy, mushy, man they got us set in stone

Fee-fi-fo-fum, I'm the one to beat

Man, always buzzing on my phone, they wantin' me
Man, always asking for that P, they wantin' me

Selling products on the road, what the fuck is a loss?
Cross the line, then I'll [?] up your shit
Then I'll DOS up your shit
Cause I don't give a shit
Then I'll leave you no bit
Cause your memory full, go set that format card
We in the new age, on a new stage
I ain't fucking with your pass on a new page
Living in a better home, twenty-three-year-old
Started really killing it, when when he met the love of chrome
Over powered, in the zone, let them niggas really know
Runnin' everywhere, pass the ding like I'm on the gong
I got one track with more views than a bad man getting in a whole lifetime, it is sad man

You fools are faker than that YouPorn site
Show me that locals wanna fuck me when I'm spraying white
Know that I'm always on my grind, on it day and night
Looking behind, I see no nigga coming near my sight
Don't come at me when I'm poppin'
Don't talk to me, you're more inbred than yeast
Saying the least, freeing the jungle, the ultimate beast
Fuck all the haters, get touched by a priest

Yeah, yeah..

"Ares (Quadeca Diss Track)"

[Chorus]
Hm Hm Hm
Hm Hm Hm Hm
You dare test me

Zeeshan


[Verse 1: KSI]
Ares looking down on the boy feeling like he at the top
Now you better listen 'cos this nigga never wanted hippodrome
But I gotta let them know you're a flop
Not a single boom with 4 records on the trot
Now the little Ben was mad that his records never popped
'Till he spoke about his idol
Now he's going viral
Biggest song you'll ever make is author of the bible
I'm the creed of the crop
The rocky with the cash
While you're tryna say the words
Suffering succotash
Baby panicking awkward like mannequin
Motherfucker we're battling
This the fall of the Anakin
Make you missing like Madaleine
You're a fan
FIFA to the football to the rapping
My reply got you jizzing was fishing and baited the stan
Please don't speak again
Hold up with your venting
Ain't it wonderful
That I'm out here reinventing your career

Keep it measure for measure where is your Isabella (Hm)
Shorty left and you struggled to keep it all together (Ay)
Not the first time you're dissing remember me and Weller
Looking back at the reinstating that you're a fan forever

[Verse 2: KSI]
Fuck your grade 5
You don't need to lie
Glad I made you better 'cos your other shit was dry
Had to make you wait 'cos I'm always up lifting
Scrawny with your size maybe try some weightlifting
Between me and you
No one wants to be you
Looked at your past even you know it's true
Look at that baby face, look at that baby face
You can't intimidate
Boy it's my creed to assassinate
I'm not one to agitate
Crying that my roster overpowered like the Golden State
Corny rappers try'na build a coup so they can elevate
No one's even ever heard of you
Until I commentated and slated
Got irritated and hated
But deep inside you're elated
You even tweeted and rated the lyrical miracle
This you peaking at pinnacle
Taste of your medicine going and flowing at minimal
Show me you're unusual
Spit a verse where I'm not as a feature
Bet it's never better than the dissing at your teacher
Bet it never blows up all according to your preacher
Calculated moves
I'm the instigator
Forever in my shadow blessing like your given name
I'm drinking desperado you can't even do the same
Commend your new bravado
Thank me 'cos I'm here to blame
And if we ever played
I'll still beat you at a Fifa game

Hahaha
Dax
Stop it man you ain't that
Poor man's Hopsin now wanna box
Please, you're gonna get dropped
Now crypt wanna hop on my dick
Stupid little prick you were never involved
You can rap fast but you can't make a hit
Lullaby Rap or die hope you die, bitch
I got no label
And I always kill it like Cain and Abel
Can't be broke, I'll revoke your progress
'Cos I am the table
You bitches are botching
I'm the one that they paid to be watching
You tried with the diss
Got you bare views with the vids
Tried to score but you missed
Haa

[Verse 3: KSI]
I am the king of the drama
Cream of the crop
I'm the new age farmer
Puppet man I don't stop it man
I give all the shit with no karma
I am untouchable I got the rocket fuel
I am unstoppable nothing impossible
Album impeccable touring while winning as me
Years in the game and I do it so easily
"I'm a Celebrity" called for me
I said no to that shit
I don't need to eat dick
I'm self made in this bitch
I'm like Raid when I spray
People die when I prey
People lie when I slay
Jack of all trades and I mastered it all as I win
Bring out the Perry and prove I'm a king
Q-Q-Quad

[Chorus]
Hahaha
This shit's easy for me
All day, every day
Another one
Ay ay, ay ay
Ay ay

Zeeshan

Fuck loans
50k out to a nigga, rollin' as a brittle figure
Wonder why you 'tryna throw stones
I know many fabricated, done in feeling obligated, while the proof is on my four phones
Never lacking with the viewin', always watching what I'm brewin', you should see the way I chew bones (Grr)
I like every single crack crack, way more satisfying than a pussy with a click clack
Gassed over protein, I pimped out my whole team
Started from 18, been choppin' up in that guillotine
Been poppin' off in that limousine
Then hoppin' off in that submarine
I was 17 when I had a dream now they wanna kill it with a laser beam, Fuck that
I'm not that young, I got that contract
Provin' all that I'm a young don, I bring that impact
Hate me like Lü Bu, I'd rather go through you, my rampage cause outrage and this just the preview still

[Chorus]
When the bottles start poppin', and the champagne pours
You feel like the man, and the world's all yours
This shit don't last forever, man
Nah, this shit don't last forever
When the money comes in and it rains and it pours
And it feels like the world's all yours, nah
This shit don't last forever, man
Nah, this shit don't last forever, man

[verse: 1]
Champagne Papi, tell me who is gonna stop me (No one)
Come through cocky, ain't no wonder she gon' fuck me
I'm the actor and the athlete
Know you got your ass beat
I'm not texting back if I'm fucking and it's a bad beat
D-D-Dead beat dad tried it but this just ain't your climate, man
Over a year in music
I look and see I'm still the man
Found it amazing
How I'm still raising the level
And crushing
They're praising
I'm blushing still winning all while your mixtape did nothing
Singles did nothing
Shame that your kid won't see you as a something
My riches are stunning
My bitches are stunning
My PA can't keep up with things that I'm running
I'm the Jack of all trades but I'm learning to be the master of it all
Don't you think it's evil that these niggas wanna see me fall
Well you better wait
Over time I'm staying late
Educating the masses that I'm not one to agitate

When the bottles start poppin', and the champagne pours
You feel like the man, and the world's all yours
This shit don't last forever, man
Nah, this shit don't last forever
When the money comes in and it rains and it pours
And it feels like the world's all yours
Nah, this shit don't last forever, man
Nah, this shit don't last forever, man

[verse: 2]
Living life like you're dying at thirty
Saying you working on the gram but you ain't Kylie or Kourtney
Your baby mother ain't got warm food
But your wrist froze
Kicks lookin' clean
But your daughter ain't got school clothes
Woah, that ain't the life for me, that's frightening
Daily dose of Vicodin that you been hiding in
That ain't me, nah, I play my cards on the table
No wonder I stay with the golf cart and drive to the stable
We on them different timelines but the same damn outcome (Same)
So much has changed, I'ma do it all without some
Took the scenic route so I could speak the truth
Ain't no point in dreamin' if you ain't thinkin' to see it through
Building foundations for the future
All it took was some patience
Through the hesitation, I was preppin' troops to the stations
Now I'm walking into rooms with separate elevators
I don't know if heaven's real but it's spacious

When the champagne pours (Champagne pours)
When the world's all yours (When the world's all yours)
When the bottles start poppin', and you know you want everyone to pour
When the champagne pours (Champagne pours)
When the world's all yours (When the world's all yours)
Shit don't last forever, man

"Encore"
(feat. Randolph)

[Hook - KSI:]
So can I get a fucking encore? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Can I get a fucking encore? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Can I get a fucking encore? (Yeah, motherfucker, motherfucker)
Can I get a fucking encore? (Shit, shit, oh)

[Verse 1 - KSI:]
The hype man is here
Started from FIFA to top of the tier
Got all of these stacks
"How did you do it?" is all that I hear
Man’s doing everything
Going from BRITS to us
Making that movie thing
Flying from Vegas to Napa to partying
Watching the progress I show in The Guardian
But that’s old news
First-born bringing the bread to the table
Viewing the shot on the low, other mans on the hype
Counting P’s on the top of that label
(Man) You gotta admit it
Nothing untrue when I go to just spit it
Then, my team is just killing it
Fam is just killing it
Proud of them all and I'm here to fulfil init

[Hook - KSI:]
So can I get a fucking encore? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Can I get a fucking encore? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Can I get a fucking encore? (Yeah, motherfucker, motherfucker)
Can I get a fucking encore? (Shit, shit, oh)

[Verse 2 - Randolph:]
Oh man, time to remind ‘em
This my last encore, no more rewinding
We be doing this for time and time again
About time you were tuning in
About time they were noticin'
That I’ve been going in
I'm back now and I’m closing in
To the high places I’m supposed to be in, uh
So, don’t insult me again, yeah
Anxiety, tryna get the better of me
Tryna make me forget that I am legendary
Won’t stop ’til they see me in the cemetery
I might fall, no hate is ever getting to me
It’s a new level that I been on
No more checkpoints, it’s here, it's the one
Yeah, I’m my own man now
I do whatever I want

[Hook - KSI:]
So can I get a fucking encore? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Can I get a fucking encore? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Can I get a fucking encore? (Yeah, motherfucker, motherfucker)
Can I get a fucking encore? (Shit, shit, oh)

"Keep Up"
(feat. JME)

[Kayleigh Morris:]
What's going on these days? People are getting famous from YouTube?
I mean, have you heard of that guy, KSI?
Apparently he's got millions of subscribers, and a book, and a movie, and a Lamborghini, and a song about a Lamborghini.
Who the hell are the Sidemen? All over my timeline. The world's going crazy!
All-all-all-all we really wanna know is can you keep up?

Keep up, can you can you keep up?
Keep up, can you can you keep up?
Keep up, can you can you keep up?
All we really wanna know is can you keep up?

Growing like I'm the universe
So ahead that these dudes reverse
Fly with my car when I bolt in the lead
Smash it like Hulk then I drop 'em like WWE
Parties, we doing it (big, big)
Views that I'm getting so (big, big)
Girls that I sleep with say (big, big)
Laid in America (big, big)
I'm on a roll, pass the control
Hit it worldwide when I put on a show
All-all-all-all we really wanna know is can you keep up?

This morning, I woke up on a mission
Head out the window screaming, "Fuck the competition!"
When I go missing, means I'm steady on the grind
I've got nothing but success upon my mind
Keep up

Keep up, can you can you keep up?
Keep up, can you can you keep up?
Keep up, can you can you keep up?
All we really wanna know is can you keep up?

[Kayleigh Morris:]
Have you heard of this JME guy? What the hell is 'grime' music? Is it a UK thing?
Because apparently the whole world are getting into it. How many members do you think are in this BBK gang?
Because I'm beginning to lose count. They seem to be everywhere. My little brothers and sister seem to love them.
Hmm... (serious), maybe they can't be that bad
It's JME
(all we really wanna know is can you) shut ya mouth

[JME:]
Everyone's baffed, "Who are they? Who are you?"
How's JJ got a Lambo too?
It's a simple equation, fam (what?)
You get bare Ps, if you get bare views
Like you get bare Ps if you work bare hours
And I get bare Ps if I make bare tunes
Don't hate now cause man's got powers
You get bare slaps if you get bare rude
Turn the clock back 10 years, nobody cared
Man was airing me
5 years later, my first album dropped. Now man are hearing me
Today: Integrity and Integri-tees
Man are wearing me
All-all-all-all we really wanna know
Is can you keep up? (serious)

This morning, I woke up on a mission
Head out the window screaming, "Fuck the competition!" (fuck it)
When I go missing, means I'm steady on the grind
I've got nothing but success upon my mind
Keep up

Keep up, can you can you keep up?
Keep up, can you can you keep up?
Keep up, can you can you keep up?
All we really wanna know is can you keep up?

"Lambo Refuelled"
(feat. Youngs Teflon, Sway & Scrufizzer)

[KSI:]
Fuck the rocks, man upgraded to a Hublot
Twenty million later, still dismissing like I'm Pluto
Still I'm going every time they come and see me
Still I'm going, wiling in my Lamborghini

La-Lamborghini, La-Lamborghini
Bitch, I know you see me in my Lamborghini
La-Lamborghini, La-Lamborghini
Ride so quick, you would think I'm Houdini

Round 2 motherfucker, still I'm riding low
Satin Black with Tron cause you know I got to change the flow
He goes so bitter, like killing the room
Think that you're hot like the reapers of doom?
Over nine thousand, I'm feeling a boom
So what are you saying?
Cause I'm on a roll try and catch me, fully stacked
Like an Apache 17 starting, nuke missiles coming
Grab my dick and now I got a list of girls, I'm cumming
Change the lyrics, still I'm winning with the remix incoming

[Sway:]
Course I had to hop up on the remix (my brother)
Swah the Super's always been the prefix (burning rubber)
Studio with JJ like we got one
Then he actually went and got one
Then the team said let's release it, let them stream it, let them pree it
I'm going kinda slow for the fellas, levels up and I'm still speeding
My engines warming up the scenic route so you can see it
It's Mr. CEO of DCY [?]
They see me at a show, they're like "Oh lord, I don't believe it"
(Super Swah) everybody left in the dust, better rush
When it comes to the flow man are best, think it's us
Going like a Lamborghini when I'm next to the bus
And a cosign, anybody next to the boss
Tell 'em don't second guess that the next thing is us
So we chilling in the flat just collecting the bucks
Tell the niggas in the back that the rest is enough
No officer
I ain't try'na get arrested in cuffs (no way)
If you wanna give me points
You better put out the req with the stuff
I ain't gonna stop unless it's petrol or stuff
I was built for the speed, gotta rep for the stuff
Gotta rep for the team and the direction is up
Everybody meet my brother Tef, give it up

[Youngs Teflon:]
You take it to the streets, why they take it to the tweets?
I'm a good fella, sleek with manners and dressed neat
After the king speak, they blasting the repeat
It's a game but we play for keeps, don't sleep
I wish I had a genie, I would probably have a 'Ghini
I ain't got neither, but I promise you gon' see me
Little nigga greedy cause I never had a freebie
Then I fell in love with the white girl before Yeezy
I'm a menace, you're a medi, what's a Judas to a Jedi?
Gots to get my own cause mummy told me never redeye
I'm eating but I'm try'na grab myself a mil
And I ain't even Eden, I'm a hazard on the field
Them man ain't scoring points, they switched sides like Falcao
I been running them miles though, trill nigga till the outro
Them man flow ups up, my style more south pole
My style more south pole, you was indoors, I'm an outlaw

[Scrufizzer:]
Man better know their place on a beat
Man better know their place on a song
Can't clash me, that's long
I'll lyrically spin a brudda all day long
Ain't gonna gas, ain't gonna lie
Whenever I'm on a riddim, I'm bringing that vibe
If you don't know, better get locked on
I don't think them man are ready for the don
I can't lie brudda, I ain't got a Lambo
But I was on that backroad, riding with that Rambo
Badboy, rudeboy, show me, what's your angle?
'Nough of them are talking the talk, but they can't even handle
But back to the subject, let me get real up
See man driving a German Beemer
Shout out KSI for the feature
Let me do it, they're beginning, really can't see us
Let me get deeper
I don't wanna say too much
But I'm flowing like I'm wiling in a Lamborghini

[KSI:]
La-Lamborghini, La-Lamborghini
Bitch, I know you see me in my Lamborghini
La-Lamborghini, La-Lamborghini
Ride so quick, you would think I'm Houdini

"Smoke 'N' Mirrors"
(feat. Tiggs Da Author, Lunar C & Nick Brewer)

[Tiggs Da Author:]
Look at myself I see my face
In blurry visions everyday
Smoke 'n' mirrors
Blind me from the way
Smoke 'n' mirrors
Blind me from the way

[KSI:]
I see your hidden agenda
Had to send me shit, but I'm killing the sender
Riding on my shit, then I left it to render
And nigga I'm the shit, came up with like I'm Slender
Man, I'm on a high one
Counting all my worries (Oh no, I've got none)
Counting all my monies (Oh wait, you want some)
Suck one, I don't give a shit
And I'm not wearing your tees
I've got my old girls
Now here, chilling on knees
I've got my new girls
Now here, willing to please
I'm on the next ting, quick ting
Why not check things
Still I'm still a young ting
Ain't that something
Living life like I never thought I could
With my team here around and everything is all good
And then I

[Tiggs Da Author:]
Look at myself I see my face
In blurry visions everyday
Smoke 'n' mirrors
Blind me from the way
Smoke 'n' mirrors
Blind me from the way

[Lunar:]
I grew up poor
Everyday I wore that same dirty Yankee cap
Roll over my eyes, I didn't want to talk to no one I was angry
fast-forward to a month ago I was in the new era
Office and they let me take what I like imagine that
I guess things do change
Couldn't afford family holidays growing up
But today I been on two planes
Never begged it, why you have to go making a scene
My bars go over heads like Michelangelo painting a ceiling
Life's like a motion picture
We are blinded by smoke and mirrors
And lies we're told to give up her the desire
To go and buy all the things we can't afford but convinced that we need
I just want to be happy and not live on the street
They fucking with my chakra, I'm just tryna do me
You idealize some guy that's lying and hide behind the jewelry
Their heart is empty and their soul is hollow
Living like there's no tomorrow
I know every moments borrowed

[Tiggs Da Author:]
Smoke 'n' mirrors
Blind me from the way
Smoke 'n' mirrors
Blind me from the way

[Nick Brewer:]
I don't wanna get lost on this long road
I've been looking for something hoping it unfolds
But I see a lot of smoke in the air
Another look in the mirror but the reflection is unknown
I'm a grown man loosing my mind
I tell myself I'm doing just fine too many times
But man a dead weight, my boy say, "get your head straight"
I'm like "brother you can say that again"

But I never would imagine this chain of events
I remember when I just wanted some fame in the ends
Trying to do all the same as my friends
And it's funny how I switched up, maybe sing your next song
Why we wanna see clear looking through the
I don't wanna be here, when I get a glimpse

[Tiggs Da Author:]
Look at myself I see my face
In blurry visions everyday
Smoke 'n' mirrors
Blind me from the way
Smoke 'n' mirrors
Blind me from the way

"Touch Down"
(feat. Stefflon Don)

Touch, down
Touch, down
Touch, down
Touch, down
Touch touch, down down
Touch touch, down down
Touch touch, down down
Touch touch, down down

[KSI:]
Yo, let me touch down
Let me touch down for a sec
Calling me a star when I go on a track
Gonna get paid with a check
Can't find a place that don't know me
Can't find a site that don't show me
I know many that wanna' be me
But they can't be me 'cause I'm way too on it (owning)
Way too good when I'm owning
100 mil cause I'm owning
Shut up man and stop moaning
I break bread when I eat
Indirect with a tweet, if you wanna' have some beef
Control, alt and delete
Sign out and don't tweet

Touch, down
Touch, down
Touch, down
Touch, down
Touch touch, down down
Touch touch, down down
Touch touch, down down
Touch touch, down down

Anyway back to the matter

[Chorus]
Touch, down
Touch, down

Touch touch, down down
Touch touch, down down
Touch touch, down down
Touch touch, down down

[KSI & Stefflon Don:]
We so elite, you don't rate that
Aim for tough, you won't get that
Copycats don't make it far, so tell your chances (au revoir)
Adios, sayonara
Fuck you I'll make the drama, start a scene queen fit
Threesome with the main chick
Threesome with your main bitch
Then go Waka Flocka with a choppa choppa
You done done it better than the other brother's
Other niggas shooting and I ain't talking cannons

[Outro]
Touch, down
Touch, down
Touch, down
Touch, down
Touch touch, down down
Touch touch, down down

Touch touch, down down

"OP"

[Chorus]
Yeah, OP
Yeah, ok

Fee-fi-fo-fum, I'm the one to beat
One-three-three-seven, I'm among elite
S-o-l-o, I don't need a feat
I'm OP, man, I don't need to cheat

[verse: 1]
Man, I'm on a roll
Throw it in the air, cause a lady on a pole
Showing off their asses, got her brothers saying wow
Said she had no pants on, brother she a hoe, oh
I don't know how we did this shit alone
Not so long ago, had my people on the phone
Talk about the past while we're hidden in cologne
Mushy, mushy, mushy, man they got us set in stone

Fee-fi-fo-fum, I'm the one to beat
One-three-three-seven, I'm among elite
S-o-l-o, I don't need a feat
I'm OP, man, I don't need to cheat
Fee-fi-fo-fum, I'm the one to beat
One-three-three-seven, I'm among elite
S-o-l-o, I don't need a feat
I'm OP, man, I don't need to cheat

[verse: 2]
I game, they pay, who wouldn't wanna be?
Man, always buzzing on my phone, they wantin' me
Man, always asking for that P, they wantin' me
Man, always asking for the D, she want a piece
Selling products on the road, what the fuck is a loss?
Cross the line, then I'll [?] up your shit
Then I'll DOS up your shit
Cause I don't give a shit
Then I'll leave you no bit
Cause your memory full, go set that format card
We in the new age, on a new stage
I ain't fucking with your pass on a new page
Living in a better home, twenty-three-year-old
Started really killing it, when when he met the love of chrome
Over powered, in the zone, let them niggas really know
Runnin' everywhere, pass the ding like I'm on the gong
I got one track with more views than a bad man getting in a whole lifetime, it is sad man

OP, OP, motherfucker
I'm OP, OP motherfucker
I'm OP, OP motherfucker
I'm OP, OP motherfucker
I'm OP, OP motherfucker

S-o-l-o, I don't need a feat
I'm OP, man, I don't need to cheat
Fee-fi-fo-fum, I'm the one to beat
One-three-three-seven, I'm among elite
S-o-l-o, I don't need a feat
I'm OP, man, I don't need to cheat

You fools are faker than that YouPorn site
Show me that locals wanna fuck me when I'm spraying white
Know that I'm always on my grind, on it day and night
Looking behind, I see no nigga coming near my sight
Don't come at me when I'm poppin'
Don't talk to me, you're more inbred than yeast
Saying the least, freeing the jungle, the ultimate beast
Fuck all the haters, get touched by a priest

Yeah, yeah..

"Goes Off"
(feat. Mista Silva)

Ay, KSI

[Mista Silva & KSI:]
They see us now we're on the internet
We don't care bout what they say or what they said
Let them know that this is my house
We're blacking out like somebody just turned the lights out

It goes off like

We know that it (Goes off!)
She knows that it (Goes off!)

Um, roadblock
Every time we show up
Bangers that we load up
Make your Grandma's do the robot
Haters they get no love
Ladies looking so hot
We should play strip FIFA
Goals and goals then clothes off
Snap, snap, go hard
Go fast when I drove past
When I hit the club, drinks on me
No limit tab, no plan B
Cuz, this ting is so nuts
Whole crowd with their phones up
Posing for a picture now I'm ready for my close up

They see us now we're on the internet

Come up then we load up
Playing then we show up
Screaming 'cos we blew up
Fuck the fame I'm here to turn up
Motherfucker I'm a nerd
Still I'm catching birds
Dissin' stop your bitchin'
Made the riches with my words
Making pasta in the kitchen
Shit is finger licking
Now they acting so suspicious
'Cos my serving so delicious

Everytime when we go ballin' as a MOB (Jump around!)
All together when we jump up we go off

Everybody jump, (jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump)
Everybody jump, (jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump)

Jump when it's playin', jump on a plane
Jump in a whip, jump on the stage
Jump in a hotel, jump in the rave
Jump in an Aston, jump in a Range

Get a birds eye view, lose your mind 'til you get a worse IQ
Her eyes brown and her eyes blue
It's not a problem if I haven't said the words "I do"

Jump up and down, shorty moshpit
Jump up and down, shorty moshpit
Your main girl look like a sidechick
My dreads lie wild like a rockstar
Party turned up, we don't need a ball
I came a long way from a rockstar
Look at Waka Flocka Flame standing on a cop car
Off the car crowdsurf in the crowd
Everybody hands up, yeah loud
I'm a party animal, I took a bow
Me and KSI, boy it's going down

[KSI:]
Everytime when we go all in in the club (Jump around!)
Everytime when we go ballin' as a MOB (Jump around!)

"Sticks & Stones"
(feat. Arjun)

[Arjun:]
Saving moments in the pictures on my phone
And I know I never wanna live it on my own
I don't want to care about the problems in my zone
So I feel no pain when you throw your sticks and stones
So I'm saving moments in the pictures on my phone
And I know I never wanna live it on my own
I don't want to care about the problems in my zone
So I feel no pain when you throw your sticks and stones

[KSI:]
I remember the days when you laughed at division
Telling me to stay in the lane with the peak of my life is the whip for permission
Nah impossible mission imma do it
And no riding the wave and not lose it
Didn't come here for life to live but live the life
I don't care if you're a cynic
Just like The Rock in '01 imma bring it
Bring a new vibe in the taste for the better
I don't care for the weather
Bring the whole team and they'll win it all together
Yea yea
Ain't laughing now
Getting on the flashbacks and the throwbacks look at all these pics
Moments that I live for
Standing on the cliff for
Where you always find me

[Arjun:]
Saving moments in the pictures on my phone
And I know I never wanna live it on my own
I don't want to care about the problems in my zone
So I feel no pain when you throw your sticks and stones
So I'm saving moments in the pictures on my phone
And I know I never wanna live it on my own
I don't want to care about the problems in my zone
So I feel no pain when you throw your sticks and stones

[KSI:]
This my life I'm gonna live it
Didn't come here to stop and just quit it
Didn't come here to flop and just bin it
Didn't come here to listen to
All the people who hate the fact that I did it
Thinking never slave for the come up
And rather team risk wanna prismata
Took it on the chin and then kill with a celeb
I came, I saw, and I conquered
How did I give up the reigns and I plondered
Just gotta do it again
And kill it again, And do it again
And kill it again, And do it again
Everything I do, no I do it all for you
So savour the moment
These are all the moments that I live for
Standing on a cliff for where you're gonna find me

[Arjun:]
Saving moments in the pictures on my phone
And I know I never wanna live it on my own
I don't want to care about the problems in my zone
So I feel no pain when you throw your sticks and stones
So I'm saving moments in the pictures on my phone
And I know I never wanna live it on my own
I don't want to care about the problems in my zone
So I feel no pain when you throw your sticks and stones

"Friends With Benefits"
(feat. MNDM)

Way too young for the ring ting
Now you wanna dance on a king ping
Sixty-eight plus one, that's a win-win
Time to slide in like a penguin
You don't need ice, no bling bling
No hubby, no wife, just a friend ting
Live your whole life to the ending
There's no point pretending
Let's be friends, with benefits
We can chill, and Netflix
No strings, like Hendrix
Let's pimp, like Kendrick

[Verse: 1]
Let's go deep into a world, that only we can see
They can't touch us, they can't judge us cuz we're crazy young and free
It's not me troubling you
It's not you troubling me
Can I trust you not to love me?
Let's be FWBs
FWB, FWBs
FWB, FWBs

"Transforming"

[Chorus]
How you feeling?
I'm alright
Alright, Speak your mind

[verse: KSI]
Think that they know me
They don't know shit about me
Fuck what they feeling
I'll be who I wanna be
Came from the north side
Dreaming of all that I could be
I'm for the long ride
Visions more clearer to see
So many girls on my mind
But I don't see you anymore
Maybe it's cos of my life
That I don't see you anymore
Texting you begging for more
I'll make you rich if you're poor
I'll buy your favourite decor
Maybe I'm drunk on the floor

Maybe I'll slap any prick that is taking the mick
Bossing the way of my life like I'm Rick
Smoking and skiing in verbier
Party my life away
Tell me my life is the shit
I know so many that want me to quit
I did this ting back when nobody knew of it all
I hit the space of the few where my Idols turned rivals to losing to nothing at all
On track pro track
So many jumped on
My back
Yeah
I'm back, payback
Now you niggas wanna go
Backtrack I'm

Transforming
Clouds and the winds forming
See them man informing
They know that I'm transforming

Think that they know me
They don't know shit about me
Fuck what they feeling
I'll be who I wanna be
Came from the north side
Dreaming of all that I could be
I'm for the long ride
Visions more clearer to see
So many girls on my mind
But I don't see you anymore
Maybe it's cos of my life
That I don't see you anymore
Texting you begging for more
I'll make you rich if you're poor
I'll buy your favourite decor
Maybe I'm drunk on the floor

Maybe I'll setup the camp and get ready for war
I'm not the same as you saw me before
I'm at a stage where they cannot ignore
My Mentor watching, listening, this thing
So trigger happy that a leader scared to do anything
Gotta follow where the people take em but he loses will to do everything
Cos I
Did this for my
Sanity cos I
Was reaching levels so uncontrollable
None promotional
International thoughts
Travelling to chill with my thoughts
Simple thing a break from all the worshipping
They tried to kill me off like Im the Luther King
But I bounced right back
Slamming and dunking lebroning I'm like that
Niggas be stunting when they really bluffing when they say they getting it like that
I make it look like it's nothing the way that I'm running the kingdom I own
0 belief from the people I thought were my homies so I did it all on my own
God bless the Internet
Place where a person can be a threat
Showing my family to zero debt
These are the things that they won't forget and I won't regret cos I'm

Transforming
Clouds and the winds forming
See them man informing
They know that I'm transforming

[Outro]
Think that they know me
They don't know shit about me
Fuck what they feeling
I'll be who I wanna be
Came from the north side
Dreaming of all that I could be
I'm for the long ride
Visions more clearer to see
So many girls on my mind
But I don't see you anymore
Maybe it's cos of my life
That I don't see you anymore
Texting you begging for more
I'll make you rich if you're poor
I'll buy your favourite decor
Maybe I'm drunk on the floor
Maybe I'm wanting it more

""KSI - EA Rap""

[verse: 1]
I'm getting dollar dollar bills in this b**h
I'm getting hundred million dollar dollar deals in this b**h
Check that sh**, I'm hella rich
Time is money so check that hour
Made your salary in that hour
Backhand will.i.am 'cuz I'm the one with POWER

You complaining, motherf**er?
Go play Evolution Soccer
It can go and s** my dick
While I'm making money quick
Got few licensed teams
Robotic themes
Some extremes
Make their means
And it seems
"Fun" is what they say this screams

[Outro]
Unit levels sold this season is the real f**ing deal
Got Vegeta's scouter screaming "Power level is unreal"
On that next gen, cashing checks

[Skit]
What’s going on these days?
People are getting famous from YouTube?
I mean, have you heard of that guy, KSI?
Apparently he’s got millions of subscribers, and a book
And a movie, and a Lamborghini, and a song about a Lamborghini
Who the hell are the Sidemen? All over my timeline
The world’s going crazy!
All-all-all-all we really wanna know is can you keep up?

[Hook: KSI]
Keep up, can you, can you keep up?
Keep up, can you, can you keep up?
Keep up, can you, can you keep up?
All we really wanna know is can you keep up?

[Verse 1: KSI]
Growing like I’m the universe (too big)
So ahead that these dudes reverse
Fly with my car when I bolt in the lead
Smash it like Hulk then I drop ‘em like WWE
Parties, we doing it (big, big)
Views that I’m getting so (big, big)
Girls that I sleep with say (big, big)
Laid in America (big, big)
I'm on a roll, pass the control
Hit it worldwide when I put on a show
All-all-all-all we really wanna know is can you keep up?

[Pre-Hook: KSI]
This morning, I woke up on a mission
Head out the window screaming, "Fuck the competition!"
When I go missing, means I’m steady on the grind
I’ve got nothing but success up on my mind
Keep up

[Hook: KSI]
Keep up, can you, can you keep up?
Keep up, can you, can you keep up?
Keep up, can you, can you keep up?
All we really wanna know is can you keep up?

[Skit + (Jme)]
Have you heard of this Jme guy?
What the hell is 'grime' music? Is it a UK thing?
Because apparently the whole world are getting into it
How many members do you think are in this BBK gang?
Because I’m beginning to lose count
They seem to be everywhere
My little brothers and sister seem to love them. Hmm..
(Serious), maybe they can’t that bad
(It's Jme)
All we really wanna know is can you (Shut ya mouth)

[Verse 2: Jme]
Everyone’s baffed, “Who are they?, who are you?”
How's JJ got a Lambo too?
It’s a simple equation, fam (what?)
You get bare P’s, if you get bare views
Like you get bare P’s if you work bare hours
And I get bare P’s if I make bare tunes
Don’t hate now cause man’s got powers
You get bare slaps if you get bare rude
Turn the clock back 10 years, nobody cared
Man was airing me
5 years later, my first album dropped
Now man are hearing me
Today: Integrity> and Integri-tees
Man are wearing me
All-all-all-all we really wanna know
Is can you keep up? (Serious)

[Pre-Hook: KSI]
This morning, I woke up on a mission
Head out the window screaming, "Fuck the competition!" (Fuck it)
When I go missing, means I’m steady on the grind
I’ve got nothing but success up on my mind
Keep up

[Hook: KSI]
Keep up, can you, can you keep up?
Keep up, can you, can you keep up?
Keep up, can you, can you keep up?
All we really wanna know is can you keep up?

These niggas ain't ready!
You wanted this, amigo
Yeah

[Verse: KSI]
End of this, you're gonna really want to kill me
End of this, your fans are really gonna feel me
Never miss whenever suckers wanna grill me
Sorry, miss, I gotta kill him with the click, click *gunshot*
I didn't really wanna do this
So my fans be sayin', "Who this?"
But they really wanna view this
Know you're dyin' when I shoot this
Had your ex all in my DMs
Pillow talkin' in the DMs (Ayy)
Trust me, nigga, take a seat (Ayy)
Gonna have this on repeat (Ayy)
Naga Viper with the heat (Ayy)
Mr. Z Man on the beat (Ayy)
Adam had to eat the apple (Ayy)
Time to kill him in a chapel (Mm)
Adam really shit the bed (Wha?)
How you gonna shit the bed? (No)
Alesa told me you were cryin' (Huh!)
Nigga, this shit had me dyin' (Rah!)
Had to clean up all your noodles (Mm)
I expect that from a poodle (Mm)
And you know the best part? (What?)
Adam thought it was a fart (Damn!)
Damn, nigga, haven't even pulled the trigger
You should never try to diss the nigga
One-seven milli', still I'm bigger, I don't care about your bank report
At least I'm never payin' child support
But why your baby mama sayin' that you ain't even payin' that?
Ain't a game, so you never feel like playin' that?
Stop the music, bitch
And go back to blocks, you'll make more money (Yeah)
And when it comes to shocks, I got more comin' (Yeah)
When it comes to cocks, you a small summin'
When it comes to flops, you're the first running
When it comes to pops, you ain't there sonnin'
Nigga, tell me why the fuck you're cuttin' yourself?
How you're gonna be a dad when you're cuttin' yourself?
But it's not all you're doin', you fucked up and I know you're brewin'
Time to reminisce, I hope you're hearin' this
I didn't wanna be the one to be out blarin' this
But fuck it, behind the mask, you're a prick
What you did made me sick
Smearin' blood on this chick
Yeah, let's talk about Dawn
Slappin' and choking from dusk till dawn
Then blaming your alter-egos
What the fuck? That's not cool, amigo
"That's not Adam, that was John that hit you" (Yeah)
"That's not Adam, that was Shaun that beat you" (Yeah)
"That's not Adam"– nah, fuck you, Adam
Any woman beater gets the fucking heater
R.I.P. like Rita, hope you like my feature (Ha!)
That's your baby mama
Flew her over just to end the saga
KSI, I'm the king of drama (Uh)
Karma, karma, kicking down like Sparta
You will always be a dreadful father
Post Malone, he ain't savin' shit
Your tattoos are shit, chronic masturbator
Comin' now and later
Why you horny looking at an alligator? I'm your violator
This the bar on my mission
Nothin' can save your dead vision, bitch!

This is the domain (Chi), gassed up like propane (Chi)
Glowed up with gold chains (Mmm)
Bulked up with new gains (Mmm)
I'm from the World Wide Web, how I'm catchin' all these fuckin' vermin
Still I'm burnin', why they concernin' over the shit I'm earnin'?
Domain, gassed up like propane (Mmm)
Glowed up with gold chains (Chi)
Bulked up with new gains (Chi)
I'm from the World Wide Web, how I'm catchin' all these, fuckin' vermin
Still I'm curvin', I'm just confirmin' all of the shit I'm learnin'

[Verse 1]
Yeah, and I switch it up like I'm Shyamalan (Mmm)
Splittin' up how I'm making money and I stay the villain like a ShadowKhan
Nigga had to switch it up another level with the transformation, Megatron
Hungry girl wanna come along
Come fast like Ramadan
Oh, shit, now, I'm on my biz like pow
Fatal like I'm Kung Lao
I'm killin' it while the accountant is billing it
Bringin' in wishes, Dende
Athletic like I'm Llorente
My body lookin' excellente
They don't wanna hear that, toupee
Bringin' the juice (Oh yeah)
Come with the smile, breakthrough like Kool-Aid
I make the news, 'cause I come with the fight or the fact that I'm too paid
Too made, I'm from that new age
Mad at the fact that I'm still on the map, still wanna rap
Knowin' that I still wanna snap, still wanna scrap

[Chorus]
In my domain (Chi), gassed up like propane (Chi)
Glowed up with gold chains (Mmm)

Your greatest enemy
Empathy, I'm feelin' numb to it (Yeah)
Feelin' better now I cut it off (Yeah)
Visualisin' all the fun to it
Shit don't even fuckin' matter
Fuck your social ladder, fuck your social feelin' (Yeah, yeah)
I don't give a fuck about a social figure, nigga (Chi-yeah, chi-yeah)
Keep on playin' though (What?)
I'm the winner and I keep on sayin' so (What?)
I'm the sinner, but you still ain't makin' dough (Raw)
No one can break down my colony (Colony)
Look at my catalogue, I'm a different nigga in the toughest economy (Economy)
I came from the analogue
Now I went with the digital, I'm the new pinnacle
I’m bitin’ like I'm a dog, refusin' to let it go
Critical

[Intro: Future & KSI]
Oh, yeah, yeah
Lord forgive us, ooh, ooh (D-Diego)
Lord forgive us, ooh, ooh (Mally Mall)
(B-B-Bankroll Got It)
Gi-gi

[Verse 1: Future & KSI]
Hit me on my burner, hit me on my burner, ayy
All we know is murder, all we know is murder
It's goin' down in my hood
They shoot rounds in my hood, they shoot rounds in my hood (Lovely)
Tears in your eyes, on your mama cheek (Mama cheek)
Bloodstains dryin' on the concrete
Yeah, we be like, "Fuckin' all that Twitter shit"
All my niggas militant, take a hit for benefit (Gi-gi)
And I'm fuckin' all the witnesses
These stripper bitches ain't gon' say shit
Ayy, that's an unsolved freak (Freaky, freaky)
Have mеrcy on a G (Woo)

[Chorus: KSI]
Whole gang up, all my brothers lit (True)
Racks on racks, ain't too much to spеnd (Never waiting)
Old come through when they wanna lend (See they with the)
New chain chillin' and it got a twin
Ah, ooh (Yeah, yeah)
Where were you when I was down?
Where were you? (Where were you?)
Guess who is the shit now, number two (Look at you)
In the circus you a clown, look at you (You)
Bringing views (Ah)

[Verse 2: KSI]
I pick what I want then I cop, cop
That shit you dropped just gon' flop, flop
When the future is present, we pop off
Then tell me how can I drop off? (Yeah)
Their demeanour is fugazi
When you reach my level, my many medals seem lazy (Brr)
Plaque after plaque while the industry's on my back
19 on my wrist so I'm roaming it with a pack
I got runners on the ándale
They go to West whenever packin' for the holidays
Been dodging Judas since the time he kissed my money gone
Been gettin' boomers since the mainstream got their focus on
The focus' number one

[Verse 3: 21 Savage]
Never follow rules, I was skippin' school (21)
You know I ain't friendly, so quit actin' like we cool (Pussy)
Spin them niggas block 'cause we have nothin' else to do (21)
Ain't trippin' 'bout no bitch, you know I'm a player, I tie my shoes (On God)
All my diamonds hit up (21)
Wet your block in a pick up (21)
All-all my cars they go fast, face ain't shit but I like her ass
I don't love her but I love my cash, COVID-19, I'm wearin' my mask
You know I'm out here thuggin', so suck me like you love me (Facts)
Last opp played with us, we turned his ass duppy (Whack)
I'm a big dog and I love to step on puppy (21)
Two-tone Maybach, same color, Kentucky (21)

[Chorus: KSI]
Whole gang up, all my brothers lit
Racks on racks, ain't too much to spend
Old come through when they wanna lend
New chain chillin' and it got a twin
Ah, ooh (Yeah, yeah)
Where were you when I was down?
Where were you? (Where were you?)
Guess who is the shit now, number two (Look at you)
In the circus you a clown, look at you (You)
Bringing views (Ah)

[Verse 1: W2S]
Try and roast me? That's cute
You lost your virginity to a prostitute!
Was she crusty, bro? Did her vagina smell?
You bitch, I bet you paid to eat her out as well
Calling me "little boy", what the fuck's up with that?
Bro, we're both the same height, you're just more fat
And you're roasting Ethan for being the fat one in the group
You have a personal trainer, yet your titties still droop
And my diss track got more views than "Creature"
And I didn't even need a RiceGum feature
Plus, on "Earthquake", he had a better verse than you
Your rap career's finished (And you know it's true!)
You're just a meme, you're a joke artist
You've had chlamydia more times than you've charted
And you and your brother have fucked the same chick
I bet you've got his sloppy seconds all over your dick! (Ugh!)
I'm the one who's posh? You must be mistaken
Your parents paid for you to go through private education
How you making gun fingers with a straight face?
You had to wear a suit to school, you fucking disgrace
And you're saying I do drugs, you hypocrite
Did you forget about Ibiza when you snorted all that shit?
I'm talking bump after bump after bump after bump
Motherfucker, you had a blocked nose for a month!
Does your girlfriend know that you cheated on your ex
Or does she have no idea that she might be next?


[Interlude: W2S & KSI]
Speaking of, uh, of JJ's ex
This is an unreleased tune that he wrote about her
It's that stupid boy you love and hate
Always had our issues but then after we would fornicate
Looking back when all your friends would hate me, but I didn't care
No one understands

[Verse 2: W2S]
If you're having girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I'm loving my life, banging JJ's mum
(Banging JJ's mum)
(Banging JJ's mum)
Did you know JJ wanks onto his mattress?
Doesn't clean it, sleeps on it – bro, that's stress
And wanna know something else completely grim?
Seana once gave him a handjob and he came on his own chin
Has anyone bought his EP? Who did? (No one)
Your music is shit, you're so deluded
Your own label doesn't rate you, and that's the truth
They're all creasing when you step inside the booth
You're a laughingstock, bro, not even being funny (Nope)
They only gas you up because you're making them money
Deleting your old videos, are you dumb?
Stop being so ashamed of where you came from
The old KSI was what made us all fans
This evolved KSI is a fucking wasteman

[Intro: S-X]
I don't need, yeah

[Chorus: S-X]
I don't need gifts, I am the gift, yeah
I don't need gifts, nah (Ayy), I am the gift, yeah
I don't need gifts, nah, nah, I don't need gifts
I don't need, I don't need, nah, nah, nah
Why? 'Cause I am the gift

[Verse 1: KSI]
Ho-ho-ho (Ahh), lyrical father bringing that Santa flow
She wanna take my presents (Ooh), pump up the pipe and give her that white snow
I sleigh on these bitches, they know I fuck up a Christmas (Ahh)
My mama watches (Ayy), sprayin' my holy water (Chyeah), so religious
(Chyeah, chyeah, chyeah)

[Verse 2: TBJZL & Miniminter]
Run up on your block in the snow, man'll do it no plow, man'll do it no plow
Yeah, the flow ain't mine 'cause I'm feeling ill, I beg someone ask me how (How?)
Well, I got checked up and my doctor said that it's influenza (My chwest)
But I'm in the booth tryna be a rapper, not an influencer (Mm-mm)

[Chorus: S-X]
I don't need gifts, I am the gift, yeah
I don't need gifts, nah (Ayy), I am the gift, yeah
I don't need gifts, nah, nah, I don't need gifts
I don't need, I don't need, nah, nah, nah
Why? 'Cause I am the gift

[Verse 3: Miniminter & KSI]
Ethan likes Father Christmas 'cause he missed his (LOL!)
Snow ain't the type of white on Harry's wish list
Vik doesn't even really celebrate Christmas (Nah, nah)
And Jme, Shakka, know I'm carrying your business

[Verse 4: Zerkaa with KSI, S-X, Miniminter & Tobi]
Yeah, yeah, bitch, we always growin', like a tumour (Mad)
Old man, yeah, my greys are showin' – OK, boomer
Ethan if he was a woman – Amy Schumer (Haha)
Never leave a kid with Vik – just a rumour

[Chorus: S-X]
I don't need gifts, I am the gift, yeah
I don't need gifts, nah (Ayy), I am the gift, yeah
I don't need gifts, nah, nah, I don't need gifts
I don't need, I don't need, nah, nah, nah
Why?
I don't need gifts, I am the gift, yeah
I don't need gifts, nah (Ayy), I am the gift, yeah
I don't need gifts, nah, nah, I don't need gifts
I don't need, I don't need, nah, nah, nah
Why? 'Cause I am the gift

[Outro: KSI, (S-X), TBJZL, Zerkaa & Miniminter]
Yeah, yeah, still want that knockdown
(Christmas tree) (Knockdown)
Mince pies (Knockdown)
Brussel sprouts (Knockdown)
Santa Claus (Knockdown)
Greg Paul (Knockdown)
Knockdown, knockdown, knockdown

[Verse 1: Randolph]
Emile Heskey, the Chuck Norris of football
He got so many talents to easily drop your jaw
The way he dribbles down the side line and looks likely to score
Then steps over but falls over and then misses the goal
He be the greatest to ever grace us with his two left feet
That's why we watch him like every week
Defenders get weak at the knees when he breezes past with ease
Please, don't you dare diss the messiah
A true patriot for the country, yeah he's taking us higher

[Chorus: Randolph]
You don't know what you're messing with
This is Heskey kid, he's the best there is
When he fakes his shot and hits with his left
He still, misses: Heskey
You don't know what you're messing with
This is Heskey kid, he's the best there is
When he fakes his shot and hits with his left
He still, misses: Heskey

[Verse 2: Randolph & KSI]
You think that you can
Bend it like Beckham, but can you bend it like Heskey?
The way he'll shoot, but curves it around
And end up in row Zee (or row Zed)
And don't even get me started on his head
When he puts it down and gives you the eyes
You know it's Heskey time

[Verse 3: KSI]
Hahaha
Bitch I'm Heskey
You don't wanna mess with me
If you do, you're gonna be my next anal recipe
I'm too quick for the sex offenders list
I be over that
When I set my eyes on you, there's no escape
You know that

[Chorus: Randolph]
You don't know what you're messing with
This is Heskey kid, he's the best there is
When he fakes his shot and hits with his left
He still, misses: Heskey
You don't know what you're messing with
This is Heskey kid, he's the best there is
When he fakes his shot and hits with his left
He still, misses: Heskey

[Bridge: Randolph]
Heskey
Yeah, it's Heskey
Darn right, it's Heskey
I told you it was Heskey
